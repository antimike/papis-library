abstract: In this paper we show how to describe the general theory of a linear metric
  compatible connection with the theory of Clifford valued differential forms. This
  is done by realizing that for each spacetime point the algebra of Clifford bivectors
  is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of Sl(2,C). In that way the pullback of the linear
  connection under a trivialization of the bundle is represented by a Clifford valued
  1-form. That observation makes it possible to realize Einstein's gravitational theory
  can be formulated in a way which is similar to a Sl(2,C) gauge theory. Some aspects
  of such approach is discussed. Also, the theory of the covariant spinor derivative
  of spinor fields is introduced in a novel way, allowing for a physical interpretation
  of some rules postulated for that covariant spinor derivative in the standard theory
  of these objects. We use our methods to investigate some polemical issues in gravitational
  theories and in particular we scrutinize a supposedly "unified" field theory of
  gravitation and electromagnetism proposed by M. Sachs and recently used in a series
  of papers. Our results show that Sachs did not attain his objective and that recent
  papers based on that theory are ill conceived and completely invalid both as Mathematics
  and Physics.
