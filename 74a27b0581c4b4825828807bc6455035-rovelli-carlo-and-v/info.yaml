abstract: 'Passerini and Severini have recently shown that the Braunstein-Ghosh-Severini
  (BGS) entropy S(Gamma) = -Tr[rho(Gamma) log rho(Gamma)] of a certain density matrix
  rho(Gamma) naturally associated to a graph Gamma, is maximized, among all graphs
  with a fixed number of links and nodes, by regular graphs. We ask if this result
  can play a role in quantum gravity, and be related to the apparent regularity of
  the physical geometry of space. We show that in Loop Quantum Gravity the matrix
  rho(Gamma) is precisely the Hamiltonian operator (suitably normalized) of a non-relativistic
  quantum particle interacting with the quantum gravitational field, if we restrict
  elementary area and volume eigenvalues to a fixed value. This operator provides
  a spectral characterization of the physical geometry, and can be interpreted as
  a state describing the spectral information about the geometry available when geometry
  is measured by its physical interaction with matter. It is then tempting to interpret
  its BGS entropy S(Gamma) as a genuine physical entropy: we discuss the appeal and
  the difficulties of this interpretation.'
