abstract: We present the analysis of the interrelation between two processes accounting
  for the spreading of an epidemics, and the information awareness to prevent its
  infection, on top of multiplex networks. This scenario is representative of an epidemic
  process spreading on a network of persistent real contacts, and a cyclic information
  awareness process diffusing in the network of virtual social contacts between the
  same individuals. The topology corresponds to a multiplex network where two diffusive
  processes are interacting affecting each other. The analysis using a Microscopic
  Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) reveals the phase diagram of the incidence of the epidemics
  and allows to capture the evolution of the epidemic threshold depending on the topological
  structure of the multiplex and the interrelation with the awareness process. Interestingly,
  the critical point for the onset of the epidemics has a critical value (meta-critical
  point) defined by the awareness dynamics and the topology of the virtual network,
  from which the onset increases and the epidemics incidence decreases.
