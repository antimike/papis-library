abstract: Dual superconformal invariance has recently emerged as a hidden symmetry
  of planar scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This symmetry can
  be made manifest by expressing amplitudes in terms of `momentum twistors', as opposed
  to the usual twistors that make the ordinary superconformal properties manifest.
  The relation between momentum twistors and on-shell momenta is algebraic, so the
  translation procedure does not rely on any choice of space-time signature. We show
  that tree amplitudes and box coefficients are succinctly generated by integration
  of holomorphic delta-functions in momentum twistors over cycles in a Grassmannian.
  This is analogous to, although distinct from, recent results obtained by Arkani-Hamed
  et al. in ordinary twistor space. We also make contact with Hodges' polyhedral representation
  of NMHV amplitudes in momentum twistor space.
