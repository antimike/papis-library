abstract: We first describe a metric for uncertain probabilities called opinion, and
  subsequently a set of logical operators that can be used for logical reasoning with
  uncertain propositions. This framework which is called subjective logic uses elements
  from the Dempster-Shafer belief theory and we show that it is compatible with binary
  logic and probability calculus.
