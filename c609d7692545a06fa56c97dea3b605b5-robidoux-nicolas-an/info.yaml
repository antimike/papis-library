abstract: "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p> Mimetic discretization methods\
  \ for the numerical solution of continuum mechanics \n\t\t\tproblems directly use\
  \ vector calculus and differential forms identities for their \n\t\t\tderivation\
  \ and analysis. Fully mimetic discretizations satisfy discrete analogs of \n\t\t\
  \tthe continuum theory results used to derive energy inequalities. Consequently,\
  \ \n\t\t\tcontinuum arguments carry over and can be used to show that discrete problems\
  \ \n\t\t\tare well-posed and discrete solutions converge. A fully mimetic discrete\
  \ vector \n\t\t\tcalculus on three dimensional tensor product grids is derived and\
  \ its key properties \n\t\t\tproven. Opinions regarding the future of the field\
  \ are stated.</jats:p>"
