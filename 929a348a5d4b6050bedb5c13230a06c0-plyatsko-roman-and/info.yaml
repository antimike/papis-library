abstract: A new representation, which does not contain the third-order derivatives
  of the coordinates, of the exact Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, describing
  the motion of a spinning test particle, is obtained under the assumption of the
  Mathisson-Pirani condition in a Kerr background. For this purpose the integrals
  of energy and angular momentum of the spinning particle as well as a differential
  relationship following from the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations are used. The
  form of these equations is adapted for their computer integration with the aim to
  investigate the influence of the spin-curvature interaction on the particle's behavior
  in the gravitational field without restrictions on its velocity and spin orientation.
  Some numerical examples for a Schwarzschild background are presented.
