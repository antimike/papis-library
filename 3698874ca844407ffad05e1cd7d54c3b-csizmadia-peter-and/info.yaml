abstract: A new numerical method is introduced to study the problem of time evolution
  of generic non-linear dynamical systems in four-dimensional spacetimes. It is assumed
  that the time level surfaces are foliated by a one-parameter family of codimension
  two compact surfaces with no boundary and which are conformal to a Riemannian manifold
  C. The method is based on the use of a multipole expansion determined uniquely by
  the induced metric structure on C. The approach is fully spectral in the angular
  directions. The dynamics in the complementary 1+1 Lorentzian spacetime is followed
  by making use of a fourth order finite differencing scheme with adaptive mesh refinement.   In
  checking the reliability of the introduced new method the evolution of a massless
  scalar field on a fixed Kerr spacetime is investigated. In particular, the angular
  distribution of the evolving field in to be superradiant scattering is studied.
  The primary aim was to check the validity of some of the recent arguments claiming
  that the Penrose process, or its field theoretical correspondence---superradiance---does
  play crucial role in jet formation in black hole spacetimes while matter accretes
  onto the central object. Our findings appear to be on contrary to these claims as
  the angular dependence of a to be superradiant scattering of a massless scalar field
  does not show any preference of the axis of rotation. In addition, the process of
  superradiance, in case of a massless scalar field, was also investigated. On contrary
  to the general expectations no energy extraction from black hole was found even
  though the incident wave packets was fine tuned to be maximally superradiant. Instead
  of energy extraction the to be superradiant part of the incident wave packet fails
  to reach the ergoregion rather it suffers a total reflection which appears to be
  a new phenomenon.
