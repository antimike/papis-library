abstract: In the first part of this thesis, Kerr-Schild metrics and extended Kerr-Schild
  metrics are analyzed in the context of higher dimensional general relativity. Employing
  the higher dimensional generalizations of the Newman-Penrose formalism and the algebraic
  classification of spacetimes based on the existence and multiplicity of Weyl aligned
  null directions, we establish various geometrical properties of the Kerr-Schild
  congruences, determine compatible Weyl types and in the expanding case discuss the
  presence of curvature singularities. We also present known exact solutions admitting
  these Kerr-Schild forms and construct some new ones using the Brinkmann warp product.
  In the second part, the influence of quantum corrections consisting of quadratic
  curvature invariants on the Einstein-Hilbert action is considered and exact vacuum
  solutions of these quadratic gravities are studied in arbitrary dimension. We investigate
  classes of Einstein spacetimes and spacetimes with a null radiation term in the
  Ricci tensor satisfying the vacuum field equations of quadratic gravity and provide
  examples of these metrics.
