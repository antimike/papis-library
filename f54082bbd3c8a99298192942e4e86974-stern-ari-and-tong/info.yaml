abstract: In this paper, we develop a structure-preserving discretization of the Lagrangian
  framework for electromagnetism, combining techniques from variational integrators
  and discrete differential forms. This leads to a general family of variational,
  multisymplectic numerical methods for solving Maxwell's equations that automatically
  preserve key symmetries and invariants.   In doing so, we demonstrate several new
  results, which apply both to some well-established numerical methods and to new
  methods introduced here. First, we show that Yee's finite-difference time-domain
  (FDTD) scheme, along with a number of related methods, are multisymplectic and derive
  from a discrete Lagrangian variational principle. Second, we generalize the Yee
  scheme to unstructured meshes, not just in space but in 4-dimensional spacetime.
  This relaxes the need to take uniform time steps, or even to have a preferred time
  coordinate at all. Finally, as an example of the type of methods that can be developed
  within this general framework, we introduce a new asynchronous variational integrator
  (AVI) for solving Maxwell's equations. These results are illustrated with some prototype
  simulations that show excellent energy and conservation behavior and lack of spurious
  modes, even for an irregular mesh with asynchronous time stepping.
