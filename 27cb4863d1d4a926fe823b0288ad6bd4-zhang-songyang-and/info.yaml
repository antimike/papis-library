abstract: Signal processing over graphs has recently attracted significant attentions
  for dealing with structured data. Normal graphs, however, only model pairwise relationships
  between nodes and are not effective in representing and capturing some high-order
  relationships of data samples, which are common in many applications such as Internet
  of Things (IoT). In this work, we propose a new framework of hypergraph signal processing
  (HGSP) based on tensor representation to generalize the traditional graph signal
  processing (GSP) to tackle high-order interactions. We introduce the core concepts
  of HGSP and define the hypergraph Fourier space. We then study the spectrum properties
  of hypergraph Fourier transform and explain its connection to mainstream digital
  signal processing. We derive the novel hypergraph sampling theory and present the
  fundamentals of hypergraph filter design based on the tensor framework. We present
  HGSP-based methods for several signal processing and data analysis applications.
  Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement using our
  HGSP framework over some traditional signal processing solutions.
