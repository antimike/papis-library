abstract: 'The measurement called accessibility has been proposed as a means to quantify
  the efficiency of the communication between nodes in complex networks. This article
  reports important results regarding the properties of the accessibility, including
  its relationship with the average minimal time to visit all nodes reachable after
  $h$ steps along a random walk starting from a source, as well as the number of nodes
  that are visited after a finite period of time. We characterize the relationship
  between accessibility and the average number of walks required in order to visit
  all reachable nodes (the exploration time), conjecture that the maximum accessibility
  implies the minimal exploration time, and confirm the relationship between the accessibility
  values and the number of nodes visited after a basic time unit. The latter relationship
  is investigated with respect to three types of dynamics, namely: traditional random
  walks, self-avoiding random walks, and preferential random walks.'
