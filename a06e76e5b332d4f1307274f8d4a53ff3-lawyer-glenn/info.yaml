abstract: Centrality measures such as the degree, k-shell, or eigenvalue centrality
  can identify a network's most influential nodes, but are rarely usefully accurate
  in quantifying the spreading power of the vast majority of nodes which are not highly
  influential. The spreading power of all network nodes is better explained by considering,
  from a continuous-time epidemiological perspective, the distribution of the force
  of infection each node generates. The resulting metric, the \textit{expected force},
  accurately quantifies node spreading power under all primary epidemiological models
  across a wide range of archetypical human contact networks. When node power is low,
  influence is a function of neighbor degree. As power increases, a node's own degree
  becomes more important. The strength of this relationship is modulated by network
  structure, being more pronounced in narrow, dense networks typical of social networking
  and weakening in broader, looser association networks such as the Internet. The
  expected force can be computed independently for individual nodes, making it applicable
  for networks whose adjacency matrix is dynamic, not well specified, or overwhelmingly
  large.
