abstract: 'Most policy-relevant work on climate change in the social sciences either
  analyzes costs and benefits of particular policy options against important but often
  narrow sets of objectives or attempts to explain past successes or failures. We
  argue that an “applied forward reasoning” approach is better suited for social scientists
  seeking to address climate change, which we characterize as a “super wicked” problem
  comprising four key features: time is running out; those who cause the problem also
  seek to provide a solution; the central authority needed to address it is weak or
  non-existent; and, partly as a result, policy responses discount the future irrationally.
  These four features combine to create a policy-making “tragedy” where traditional
  analytical techniques are ill equipped to identify solutions, even when it is well
  recognized that actions must take place soon to avoid catastrophic future impacts.
  To overcome this tragedy, greater attention must be given to the generation of path-dependent
  policy interventions that can “constrain our future collective selves.” Three diagnostic
  questions result that orient policy analysis toward understanding how to trigger
  sticky interventions that, through progressive incremental trajectories, entrench
  support over time while expanding the populations they cover. Drawing especially
  from the literature on path dependency, but inverting it to develop policy responses
  going forward, we illustrate the plausibility of our framework for identifying new
  areas of research and new ways to think about policy interventions to address super
  wicked problems.'
