abstract: What do societies, the Internet, and the human brain have in common? They
  are all examples of complex relational systems, whose emerging behaviours are largely
  determined by the non-trivial networks of interactions among their constituents,
  namely individuals, computers, or neurons, rather than the properties of the units
  themselves. In the last two decades, network scientists have proposed models of
  increasing complexity to better understand real-world systems. Only recently we
  have realised that multiplexity, i.e. the coexistence of several types of interactions
  among the constituents of a complex system, is responsible for substantial qualitative
  and quantitative differences in the type and variety of behaviours that a complex
  system can exhibit. As a consequence, multilayer and multiplex networks have become
  a hot topic in complexity science. Here we provide an overview of some of the measures
  proposed so far to characterise the structure of multiplex networks, and a selection
  of models aiming at reproducing those structural properties and quantifying their
  statistical significance. Focusing on a subset of relevant topics, this brief review
  is a quite comprehensive introduction to the most basic tools for the analysis of
  multiplex networks observed in the real-world. The wide applicability of multiplex
  networks as a framework to model complex systems in different fields, from biology
  to social sciences, and the colloquial tone of the paper will make it an interesting
  read for researchers working on both theoretical and experimental analysis of networked
  systems.
