abstract: Network science is an interdisciplinary endeavor, with methods and applications
  drawn from across the natural, social, and information sciences. A prominent problem
  in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly-connected groups of nodes
  known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions
  that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks,
  which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect
  each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows
  one to study community structure in a very general setting encompassing networks
  that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple
  scales.
