abstract: We investigate the interaction of self-organized solitary current filaments
  (dissipative solitons) under the influence of noise in a planar dc gas-discharge
  system with high-ohmic barrier. These localized structures exhibit interesting properties
  such as propagation and scattering as well as the transient formation of molecules
  and clusters. To quantitatively examine these interesting properties, methods of
  stochastic data analysis are developed to determine interaction laws from experimentally
  recorded data series. It turns out that in most cases, the sign of the resulting
  interaction functions alternates with the distance of the dissipative solitons.
  This phenomenon can be connected to experimentally detectable oscillatorily decaying
  tails of the filaments, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions.
