abstract: Conventional approaches to lattice gauge theories do not properly consider
  the topology of spacetime or of its fields. In this paper, we develop a formulation
  which tries to remedy this defect. It starts from a cubical decomposition of the
  supporting manifold (compactified spacetime or spatial slice) interpreting it as
  a finite topological approximation in the sense of Sorkin. This finite space is
  entirely described by the algebra of cochains with the cup product. The methods
  of Connes and Lott are then used to develop gauge theories on this algebra and to
  derive Wilson's actions for the gauge and Dirac fields therefrom which can now be
  given geometrical meaning. We also describe very natural candidates for the QCD
  theta term and Chern-Simons action suggested by this algebraic formulation. Some
  of these formulations are simpler than currently available alternatives. The paper
  treats both the functional integral and Hamiltonian approaches.
