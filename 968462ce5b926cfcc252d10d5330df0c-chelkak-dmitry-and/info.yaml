abstract: We study the loop $O(n)$ model on the honeycomb lattice. By means of local
  non-planar deformations of the lattice, we construct a discrete stress-energy tensor.
  For $n\in [-2,2]$, it gives a new observable satisfying a part of Cauchy-Riemann
  equations. We conjecture that it is approximately discrete-holomorphic and converges
  to the stress-energy tensor in the continuum, which is known to be a holomorphic
  function with the Schwarzian conformal covariance. In support of this conjecture,
  we prove it for the case of $n=1$ which corresponds to the Ising model. Moreover,
  in this case, we show that the correlations of the discrete stress-energy tensor
  with primary fields converge to their continuous counterparts, which satisfy the
  OPEs given by the CFT with central charge $c=1/2$.   Proving the conjecture for
  other values of $n$ remains a challenge. In particular, this would open a road to
  establishing the convergence of the interface to the corresponding $\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa$
  in the scaling limit.
