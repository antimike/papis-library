abstract: The Problem of Time occurs because the `time' of GR and of ordinary Quantum
  Theory are mutually incompatible notions. This is problematic in trying to replace
  these two branches of physics with a single framework in situations in which the
  conditions of both apply, e.g. in black holes or in the very early universe. Emphasis
  in this Review is on the Problem of Time being multi-faceted and on the nature of
  each of the eight principal facets. Namely, the Frozen Formalism Problem, Configurational
  Relationalism Problem (formerly Sandwich Problem), Foliation Dependence Problem,
  Constraint Closure Problem (formerly Functional Evolution Problem), Multiple Choice
  Problem, Global Problem of Time, Problem of Beables (alias Problem of Observables)
  and Spacetime Reconstruction/Replacement Problem. Strategizing in this Review is
  not just centred about the Frozen Formalism Problem facet, but rather about each
  of the eight facets. Particular emphasis is placed upon A) relationalism as an underpinning
  of the facets and as a selector of particular strategies (especially a modification
  of Barbour relationalism, though also with some consideration of Rovelli relationalism).
  B) Classifying approaches by the full ordering in which they embrace constrain,
  quantize, find time/history and find observables, rather than only by partial orderings
  such as "Dirac-quantize". C) Foliation (in)dependence and Spacetime Reconstruction
  for a wide range of physical theories, strategizing centred about the Problem of
  Beables, the Patching Approach to the Global Problem of Time, and the role of the
  question-types considered in physics. D) The Halliwell- and Gambini-Porto-Pullin-type
  combined Strategies in the context of semiclassical quantum cosmology.
