abstract: 'Entropy drives the phase behavior of colloids ranging from dense suspensions
  of hard spheres or rods to dilute suspensions of hard spheres and depletants. Entropic
  ordering of anisotropic shapes into complex crystals, liquid crystals, and even
  quasicrystals was demonstrated recently in computer simulations and experiments.
  The ordering of shapes appears to arise from the emergence of directional entropic
  forces (DEFs) that align neighboring particles, but these forces have been neither
  rigorously defined nor quantified in generic systems. Here, we show quantitatively
  that shape drives the phase behavior of systems of anisotropic particles upon crowding
  through DEFs. We define DEFs in generic systems and compute them for several hard
  particle systems. We show they are on the order of a few times the thermal energy
  ([Formula: see text]) at the onset of ordering, placing DEFs on par with traditional
  depletion, van der Waals, and other intrinsic interactions. In experimental systems
  with these other interactions, we provide direct quantitative evidence that entropic
  effects of shape also contribute to self-assembly. We use DEFs to draw a distinction
  between self-assembly and packing behavior. We show that the mechanism that generates
  directional entropic forces is the maximization of entropy by optimizing local particle
  packing. We show that this mechanism occurs in a wide class of systems and we treat,
  in a unified way, the entropy-driven phase behavior of arbitrary shapes, incorporating
  the well-known works of Kirkwood, Onsager, and Asakura and Oosawa.'
