abstract: Efficient techniques to navigate networks with local information are fundamental
  to sample large-scale online social systems and to retrieve resources in peer-to-peer
  systems. Biased random walks, i.e. walks whose motion is biased on properties of
  neighbouring nodes, have been largely exploited to design smart local strategies
  to explore a network, for instance by constructing maximally mixing trajectories
  or by allowing an almost uniform sampling of the nodes. Here we introduce and study
  biased random walks on multiplex networks, graphs where the nodes are related through
  different types of links organised in distinct and interacting layers, and we provide
  analytical solutions for their long-time properties, including the stationary occupation
  probability distribution and the entropy rate. We focus on degree-biased random
  walks and distinguish between two classes of walks, namely those whose transition
  probability depends on a number of parameters which is extensive in the number of
  layers, and those whose motion depends on intrinsically multiplex properties of
  the neighbouring nodes. We analyse the effect of the structure of the multiplex
  network on the steady-state behaviour of the walkers, and we find that heterogeneous
  degree distributions as well as the presence of inter-layer degree correlations
  and edge overlap determine the extent to which a multiplex can be efficiently explored
  by a biased walk. Finally we show that, in real-world multiplex transportation networks,
  the trade-off between efficient navigation and resilience to link failure has resulted
  into systems whose diffusion properties are qualitatively different from those of
  appropriately randomised multiplex graphs. This fact suggests that multiplexity
  is an important ingredient to include in the modelling of real-world systems.
