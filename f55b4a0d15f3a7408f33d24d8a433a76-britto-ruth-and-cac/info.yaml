abstract: Recently, by using the known structure of one-loop scattering amplitudes
  for gluons in Yang-Mills theory, a recursion relation for tree-level scattering
  amplitudes has been deduced. Here, we give a short and direct proof of this recursion
  relation based on properties of tree-level amplitudes only.
