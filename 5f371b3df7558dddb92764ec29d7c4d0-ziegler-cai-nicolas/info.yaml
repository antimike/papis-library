abstract: Abstract Semantic Web endeavors have mainly focused on issues pertaining
  to knowledge representation and ontology design. However, besides understanding
  information metadata stated by subjects, knowing about their credibility becomes
  equally crucial. Hence, trust and trust metrics, conceived as computational means
  to evaluate trust relationships between individuals, come into play. Our major contribution
  to Semantic Web trust management through this work is twofold. First, we introduce
  a classification scheme for trust metrics along various axes and discuss advantages
  and drawbacks of existing approaches for Semantic Web scenarios. Hereby, we devise
  an advocacy for local group trust metrics, guiding us to the second part which presents
  Appleseed, our novel proposal for local group trust computation. Compelling in its
  simplicity, Appleseed borrows many ideas from spreading activation models in psychology
  and relates their concepts to trust evaluation in an intuitive fashion. Moreover,
  we provide extensions for the Appleseed nucleus that make our trust metric handle
  distrust statements.
