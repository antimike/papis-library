abstract: We investigate the static and dynamic behaviour of well localized solitary
  solutions of a three-component reaction-diffusion model in two- and three-dimensional
  space. These solutions behave like particles under many aspects and we refer to
  them as dissipative solitons. These objects may interact with each other, and are
  influenced by boundaries and inhomogeneities of the parameters. Depending on parameters
  and initial conditions they may be generated or annihilated. Reflection, scattering
  and the formation of bound states is commonly observed and dissipative solitons
  essentially retain their identity under such interactions if these are sufficiently
  weak. For parameters near to the onset of propagation, the field equations are reduced
  to a set of ordinary differential equations describing rather well the dynamical
  behaviour of many aspects of isolated and interacting dissipative solitons using
  their center coordinates and amplitudes of certain propagator modes. The work demonstrates
  that dissipative solitons are a generic self-organized pattern of reaction-diffusion
  systems, that they are rather robust under interaction and in many circumstances
  can be considered as elementary constituents of patterns of higher complexity. The
  reduced description can be looked upon as a theoretical foundation of the concept
  of dissipative solitons exhibiting particle-like behaviour. In addition, for the
  first time these equations allow a numerical investigation of systems with large
  number of dissipative solitons as they are observed experimentally. It is pointed
  out that many of the described properties of dissipative solitons are observed in
  experimental systems of reaction-diffusion type.
