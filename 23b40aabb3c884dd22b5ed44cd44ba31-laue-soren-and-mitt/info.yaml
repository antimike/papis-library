abstract: Computing derivatives of tensor expressions, also known as tensor calculus,
  is a fundamental task in machine learning. A key concern is the efficiency of evaluating
  the expressions and their derivatives that hinges on the representation of these
  expressions. Recently, an algorithm for computing higher order derivatives of tensor
  expressions like Jacobians or Hessians has been introduced that is a few orders
  of magnitude faster than previous state-of-the-art approaches. Unfortunately, the
  approach is based on Ricci notation and hence cannot be incorporated into automatic
  differentiation frameworks from deep learning like TensorFlow, PyTorch, autograd,
  or JAX that use the simpler Einstein notation. This leaves two options, to either
  change the underlying tensor representation in these frameworks or to develop a
  new, provably correct algorithm based on Einstein notation. Obviously, the first
  option is impractical. Hence, we pursue the second option. Here, we show that using
  Ricci notation is not necessary for an efficient tensor calculus and develop an
  equally efficient method for the simpler Einstein notation. It turns out that turning
  to Einstein notation enables further improvements that lead to even better efficiency.   The
  methods that are described in this paper have been implemented in the online tool
  www.MatrixCalculus.org for computing derivatives of matrix and tensor expressions.   An
