abstract: The objective of this work is twofold. On one hand, it is intended as a
  short introduction to spin networks and invariants of 3-manifolds. It covers the
  main areas needed to have a first understanding of the topics involved in the development
  of spin networks, which are described in a detailed but not exhaustive manner and
  in order of their conceptual development such that the reader is able to use this
  work as a first reading. A motivation due to R. Penrose for considering spin networks
  as a way of constructing a 3-D Euclidean space is presented, as well as their relation
  to Ponzano-Regge theory. Furthermore, the basic mathematical framework for the algebraic
  description of spin networks via quantum groups is described and the notion of a
  spherical category and its correspondence to the diagrammatic representation given
  by the Temperley-Lieb recoupling theory are presented. In order to give an example
  of topological invariants and their relation to TQFT the construction of the Turaev-Viro
  invariant is depicted and related to the Kauffman-Lins invariant. On the other hand,
  some results aiming at a decomposition theorem for non-planar spin networks are
  presented. For this, Moussouris' algorithm and some basic concepts of topological
  graph theory are explained and used, especially Kuratowski's theorem and the Rotation
  Scheme theorem.
