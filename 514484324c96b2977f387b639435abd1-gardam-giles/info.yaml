abstract: The unit conjecture, commonly attributed to Kaplansky, predicts that if
  $K$ is a field and $G$ is a torsion-free group then the only units of the group
  ring $K[G]$ are the trivial units, that is, the non-zero scalar multiples of group
  elements. We give a concrete counterexample to this conjecture; the group is virtually
  abelian and the field is order two.
