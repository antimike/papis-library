abstract: In the last decade, network science has shed new light both on the structural
  (anatomical) and on the functional (correlations in the activity) connectivity among
  the different areas of the human brain. The analysis of brain networks has made
  possible to detect the central areas of a neural system, and to identify its building
  blocks by looking at overabundant small subgraphs, known as motifs. However, network
  analysis of the brain has so far mainly focused on anatomical and functional networks
  as separate entities. The recently developed mathematical framework of multi-layer
  networks allows to perform an analysis of the human brain where the structural and
  functional layers are considered together. In this work we describe how to classify
  the subgraphs of a multiplex network, and we extend motif analysis to networks with
  an arbitrary number of layers. We then extract multi-layer motifs in brain networks
  of healthy subjects by considering networks with two layers, anatomical and functional,
  respectively obtained from diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging.
  Results indicate that subgraphs in which the presence of a physical connection between
  brain areas (links at the structural layer) coexists with a non-trivial positive
  correlation in their activities are statistically overabundant. Finally, we investigate
  the existence of a reinforcement mechanism between the two layers by looking at
  how the probability to find a link in one layer depends on the intensity of the
  connection in the other one. Showing that functional connectivity is non-trivially
  constrained by the underlying anatomical network, our work contributes to a better
  understanding of the interplay between structure and function in the human brain.
