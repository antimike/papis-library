abstract: The role played by torsion in gravitation is critically reviewed. After
  a description of the problems and controversies involving the physics of torsion,
  a comprehensive presentation of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity
  is made. According to this theory, curvature and torsion are alternative ways of
  describing the gravitational field, and consequently related to the same degrees
  of freedom of gravity. However, more general gravity theories, like for example
  Einstein-Cartan and gauge theories for the Poincare and the affine groups, consider
  curvature and torsion as representing independent degrees of freedom. By using an
  active version of the strong equivalence principle, a possible solution to this
  conceptual question is reviewed. This solution favors ultimately the teleparallel
  point of view, and consequently the completeness of general relativity. A discussion
  of the consequences for gravitation is presented.
