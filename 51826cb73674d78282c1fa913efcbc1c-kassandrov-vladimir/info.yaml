abstract: We give a brief overview of a non-Lagrangian approach to field theory based
  on a generalization of the Kerr-Penrose theorem and algebraic twistor equations.
  Explicit algorithms for obtaining the set of fundamental (Maxwell, SL(2, C)-Yang-Mills,
  spinor Weyl and curvature) fields associated with every solution of the basic system
  of algebraic equations are reviewed. The notion of a boost-invariant solution is
  introduced, and the unique axially-symmetric and boost-invariant solution which
  can be generated by twistor functions is obtained, together with the associated
  fields. It is found that this solution possesses a wide variety of point-, string-
  and membrane-like singularities exhibiting nontrivial dynamics and transmutations.
