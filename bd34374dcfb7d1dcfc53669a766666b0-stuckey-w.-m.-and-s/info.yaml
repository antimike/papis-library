abstract: We use graphical field gradients in an adynamical, background independent
  fashion to propose a new approach to quantum gravity and unification. Our proposed
  reconciliation of general relativity and quantum field theory is based on a modification
  of their graphical instantiations, i.e., Regge calculus and lattice gauge theory,
  respectively, which we assume are fundamental to their continuum counterparts. Accordingly,
  the fundamental structure is a graphical amalgam of space, time, and sources (in
  parlance of quantum field theory) called a "spacetimesource element." These are
  fundamental elements of space, time, and sources, not source elements in space and
  time. The transition amplitude for a spacetimesource element is computed using a
  path integral with discrete graphical action. The action for a spacetimesource element
  is constructed from a difference matrix K and source vector J on the graph, as in
  lattice gauge theory. K is constructed from graphical field gradients so that it
  contains a non-trivial null space and J is then restricted to the row space of K,
  so that it is divergence-free and represents a conserved exchange of energy-momentum.
  This construct of K and J represents an adynamical global constraint between sources,
  the spacetime metric, and the energy-momentum content of the element, rather than
  a dynamical law for time-evolved entities. We use this approach via modified Regge
  calculus to correct proper distance in the Einstein-deSitter cosmology model yielding
  a fit of the Union2 Compilation supernova data that matches LambdaCDM without having
  to invoke accelerating expansion or dark energy. A similar modification to lattice
  gauge theory results in an adynamical account of quantum interference.
