abstract: 'In this paper we apply the recently developed mimetic discretization method
  to the mixed formulation of the Stokes problem in terms of vorticity, velocity and
  pressure. The mimetic discretization presented in this paper and in [50] is a higher-order
  method for curvilinear quadrilaterals and hexahedrals. Fundamental is the underlying
  structure of oriented geometric objects, the relation between these objects through
  the boundary operator and how this defines the exterior derivative, representing
  the grad, curl and div, through the generalized Stokes theorem. The mimetic method
  presented here uses the language of differential $k$-forms with $k$-cochains as
  their discrete counterpart, and the relations between them in terms of the mimetic
  operators: reduction, reconstruction and projection. The reconstruction consists
  of the recently developed mimetic spectral interpolation functions. The most important
  result of the mimetic framework is the commutation between differentiation at the
  continuous level with that on the finite dimensional and discrete level. As a result
  operators like gradient, curl and divergence are discretized exactly. For Stokes
  flow, this implies a pointwise divergence-free solution. This is confirmed using
  a set of test cases on both Cartesian and curvilinear meshes. It will be shown that
  the method converges optimally for all admissible boundary conditions.'
