abstract: Based on \cite{DH94}, we introduce a bijective correspondence between first
  order differential calculi and the graph structure of the symmetric lattice that
  allows one to encode completely the interconnection structure of the graph in the
  exterior derivative. As a result, we obtain the Grassmannian character of the lattice
  as well as the mutual commutativity between basic vector-fields on the tangent space.   This
  in turn gives several similarities between the Clifford setting and the algebra
  of endomorphisms endowed by the graph structure, such as the hermitian structure
  of the lattice as well as the Clifford-like algebra of operators acting on the lattice.
  This naturally leads to a discrete version of Clifford Analysis.
