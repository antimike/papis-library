abstract: We present a derivation of the sharp-interface limit of a generic fluctuating
  phase-field model for solidification. As a main result, we obtain a sharp-interface
  projection which presents noise terms in both the diffusion equation and in the
  moving boundary conditions. The presented procedure does not rely on the fluctuation-dissipation
  theorem, and can therefore be applied to account for both internal and external
  fluctuations in either variational or non-variational phase-field formulations.
  In particular, it can be used to introduce thermodynamical fluctuations in non-variational
  formulations of the phase-field model, which permit to reach better computational
  efficiency and provide more flexibility for describing some features of specific
  physical situations. This opens the possibility of performing quantitative phase-field
  simulations in crystal growth while accounting for the proper fluctuations of the
  system.
