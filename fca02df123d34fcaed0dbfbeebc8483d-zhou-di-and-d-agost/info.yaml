abstract: It was recently recognized that interdependencies among different networks
  can play a crucial role in triggering cascading failures and hence system-wide disasters.
  A recent model shows how pairs of interdependent networks can exhibit an abrupt
  percolation transition as failures accumulate. We report on the effects of topology
  on failure propagation for a model system consisting of two interdependent networks.
  We find that the internal node correlations in each of the two interdependent networks
  significantly changes the critical density of failures that triggers the total disruption
  of the two-network system. Specifically, we find that the assortativity (i.e. the
  likelihood of nodes with similar degree to be connected) within a single network
  decreases the robustness of the entire system. The results of this study on the
  influence of assortativity may provide insights into ways of improving the robustness
  of network architecture, and thus enhances the level of protection of critical infrastructures.
