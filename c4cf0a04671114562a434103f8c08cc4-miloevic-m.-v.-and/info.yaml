abstract: A numerical approach to Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory is demonstrated and
  we review its applications to several examples of current interest in the research
  on superconductivity. This analysis also shows the applicability of the two-dimensional
  approach to thin superconductors and the re-defined effective GL parameter κ. For
  two-gap superconductors, the conveniently written GL equations directly show that
  the magnetic behavior of the sample depends not just on the GL parameter of two
  bands, but also on the ratio of respective coherence lengths. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.
