abstract: We introduce a new model of background independent physics in which the
  degrees of freedom live on a complete graph and the physics is invariant under the
  permutations of all the points. We argue that the model has a low energy phase in
  which physics on a low dimensional lattice emerges and the permutation symmetry
  is broken to the translation group of that lattice. In the high temperature, or
  disordered, phase the permutation symmetry is respected and the average distance
  between degrees of freedom is small. This may serve as a tractable model for the
  emergence of classical geometry in background independent models of spacetime. We
  use this model to argue for a cosmological scenario in which the universe underwent
  a transition from the high to the low temperature phase, thus avoiding the horizon
  problem.
