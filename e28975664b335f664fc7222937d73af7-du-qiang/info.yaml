abstract: In this paper, we review various methods for the numerical approximations
  of the Ginzburg-Landau models of superconductivity. Particular attention is given
  to the different treatment of gauge invariance in both the finite element, finite
  difference, and finite volume settings. Representative theoretical results, typical
  numerical simulations, and computational challenges are presented. Generalizations
  to other relevant models are also discussed. Â© 2005 American Institute of Physics.
