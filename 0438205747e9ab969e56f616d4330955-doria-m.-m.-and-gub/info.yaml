abstract: We propose and demonstrate the power of a novel approach to the solution
  of the Ginzburg-Landau equation based on minimizing the free-energy functional with
  the numerical technique of simulated annealing instead of minimizing it analytically
  and then solving the resulting nonlinear partial differential equations. We present
  calculations of the magnetization versus magnetic field that agree well with the
  predictions of Abrikosov and others for a homogeneous, isotropic type-II superconductor
  near Hc1 and Hc2. We also summarize the extension of the method to the calculation
  of the properties of an inhomogeneous, anisotropic superconductor. Â© 1990 The American
