abstract: Intelligence, Rationality, Learning, Anticipation and Adaptation are terms
  that have been and still remain in the central stage of computer science. These
  terms delimit their specific areas of study; nevertheless, they are so interrelated
  that studying them separately is an endeavor that seems little promising. In this
  paper, a model of study about the phenomena of Adaptation, Anticipation and Rationality
  as nature-inspired computational paradigms mimicking nature is proposed by means
  of a division, which is oriented, towards the discrimination of these terms, from
  the point of view of the complexity exhibited in the behavior of the systems, where
  these phenomena come at play. For this purpose a series of fundamental principles
  and hypothesis are proposed as well as some experimental results that corroborate
  them.
