annote: 'The application of statistical methods to physics is essential. This unique
  book on statistical physics offers an advanced approach with numerous applications
  to the modern problems students are confronted with. Therefore the text contains
  more concepts and methods in statistics than the student would need for statistical
  mechanics alone. Methods from mathematical statistics and stochastics for the analysis
  of data are discussed as well.

  The book is divided into two parts, focusing first on the modeling of statistical
  systems and then on the analysis of these systems. Problems with hints for solution
  help the students to deepen their knowledge. The third edition has been updated
  and enlarged with new sections deepening the knowledge about data analysis. Moreover,
  a customized set of problems with solutions is accessible on the Web at extras.springer.com.'
