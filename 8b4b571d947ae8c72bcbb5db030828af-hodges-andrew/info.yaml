abstract: This note addresses the problem of spurious poles in gauge-theoretic scattering
  amplitudes. New twistor coordinates for the momenta are introduced, based on the
  concept of dual conformal invariance. The cancellation of spurious poles for a class
  of NMHV amplitudes is greatly simplified in these coordinates. The poles are eliminated
  altogether by defining a new type of twistor integral, dual to twistor diagrams
  as previously studied, and considerably simpler. The geometric features indicate
  a supersymmetric extension of the formalism at least to all NMHV amplitudes, allowing
  the dihedral symmetry of the super-amplitude to be made manifest. More generally,
  the definition of `momentum-twistor' coordinates suggests a powerful new approach
  to the study of scattering amplitudes.
