abstract: We present a simple method to derive the semiclassical equations of motion
  for a spinning particle in a gravitational field. We investigate the cases of classical,
  rotating particles (pole-dipole particles), as well as particles with intrinsic
  spin. We show that, starting with a simple Lagrangian, one can derive equations
  for the spin evolution and momentum propagation in the framework of metric theories
  of gravity and in theories based on a Riemann-Cartan geometry (Poincare gauge theory),
  without explicitly referring to matter current densities (spin and energy-momentum).
  Our results agree with those derived from the multipole expansion of the current
  densities by the conventional Papapetrou method and from the WKB analysis for elementary
  particles.
