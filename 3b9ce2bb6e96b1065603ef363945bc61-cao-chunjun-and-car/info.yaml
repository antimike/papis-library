abstract: We examine how to construct a spatial manifold and its geometry from the
  entanglement structure of an abstract quantum state in Hilbert space. Given a decomposition
  of Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ into a tensor product of factors, we consider a class
  of "redundancy-constrained states" in $\mathcal{H}$ that generalize the area-law
  behavior for entanglement entropy usually found in condensed-matter systems with
  gapped local Hamiltonians. Using mutual information to define a distance measure
  on the graph, we employ classical multidimensional scaling to extract the best-fit
  spatial dimensionality of the emergent geometry. We then show that entanglement
  perturbations on such emergent geometries naturally give rise to local modifications
  of spatial curvature which obey a (spatial) analog of Einstein's equation. The Hilbert
  space corresponding to a region of flat space is finite-dimensional and scales as
  the volume, though the entropy (and the maximum change thereof) scales like the
  area of the boundary. A version of the ER=EPR conjecture is recovered, in that perturbations
  that entangle distant parts of the emergent geometry generate a configuration that
  may be considered as a highly quantum wormhole.
