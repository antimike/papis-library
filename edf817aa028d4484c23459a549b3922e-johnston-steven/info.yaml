abstract: A quantum mechanical description of particle propagation on the discrete
  spacetime of a causal set is presented. The model involves a discrete path integral
  in which trajectories within the causal set are summed over to obtain a particle
  propagator. The sum-over-trajectories is achieved by a matrix geometric series.
  For causal sets generated by sprinkling points into 1+1 and 3+1 dimensional Minkowski
  spacetime the propagator calculated on the causal set is shown to agree, in a suitable
  sense, with the causal retarded propagator for the Klein-Gordon equation. The particle
  propagator described here is a step towards quantum field theory on causal set spacetime.
