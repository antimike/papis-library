abstract: In recent years, two important techniques for geometric numerical discretization
  have been developed. In computational electromagnetics, spatial discretization has
  been improved by the use of mixed finite elements and discrete differential forms.
  Simultaneously, the dynamical systems and mechanics communities have developed structure-preserving
  time integrators, notably variational integrators that are constructed from a Lagrangian
  action principle. Here, we discuss how to combine these two frameworks to develop
  variational spacetime integrators for Maxwell's equations. Extending our previous
  work, which first introduced this variational perspective for Maxwell's equations
  without sources, we also show here how to incorporate free sources of charge and
  current.
