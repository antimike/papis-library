abstract: We propose a numerical method to solve the three-dimensional static Maxwell
  equations in a singular axisymmetric domain, generated by the rotation of a singular
  polygon around one of its sides. The mathematical tools and an in-depth study of
  the problem set in the meridian half-plane are exposed in \cite{AsCLS03}, \cite{CiLa11}.
  Here, we derive a variational formulation and the corresponding approximation method.
  Numerical experiments are proposed, and show that the approach is able to capture
  the singular part of the solution. This article can also be viewed as a generalization
  of the Singular Complement Method to three-dimensional axisymmetric problems.
