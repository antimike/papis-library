abstract: Noncommutative or `quantum' differential geometry has emerged in recent
  years as a process for quantizing not only a classical space into a noncommutative
  algebra (as familiar in quantum mechanics) but also differential forms, bundles
  and Riemannian structures at this level. The data for the algebra quantisation is
  a classical Poisson bracket, the data for the quantum differential forms is a Poisson-compatible
  connection it was recently shown that after this, classical data such as classical
  bundles, metrics etc. all become quantised in a canonical `functorial' way at least
  to 1st order in deformation theory. There are, however, fresh compatibility conditions
  between the classical Riemannian and the Poisson structures as well as new physics
  such as nonassociativity at 2nd order. We give an introduction to this theory and
  some details for the case of CP${}^n$ where the commutation relations have the canonical
  form $[w^i,\bar w^j]=\mathrm{i}\lambda\delta_{ij}$ similar to the proposal of Penrose
  for quantum twistor space. Our work provides a canonical but ultimately nonassociative
  differential calculus on this algebra and quantises the metric and Levi-Civita connection
  at lowest order in $\lambda$.
