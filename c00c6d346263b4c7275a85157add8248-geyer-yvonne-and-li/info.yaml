abstract: We develop ambitwistor string theories for 4 dimensions to obtain new formulae
  for tree-level gauge and gravity amplitudes with arbitrary amounts of supersymmetry.
  Ambitwistor space is the space of complex null geodesics in complexified Minkowski
  space, and in contrast to earlier ambitwistor strings, we use twistors rather than
  vectors to represent this space. Although superficially similar to the original
  twistor string theories of Witten, Berkovits and Skinner, these theories differ
  in the assignment of worldsheet spins of the fields, rely on both twistor and dual
  twistor representatives for the vertex operators, and use the ambitwistor procedure
  for calculating correlation functions. Our models are much more flexible, no longer
  requiring maximal supersymmetry, and the resulting formulae for amplitudes are simpler,
  having substantially reduced moduli. These are supported on the solutions to the
  scattering equations refined according to MHV degree and can be checked by comparison
  with corresponding formulae of Witten and of Cachazo and Skinner.
