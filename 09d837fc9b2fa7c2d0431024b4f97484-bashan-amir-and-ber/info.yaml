abstract: Recent studies show that in interdependent networks a very small failure
  in one network may lead to catastrophic consequences. Above a critical fraction
  of interdependent nodes, even a single node failure can invoke cascading failures
  that may abruptly fragment the system, while below this "critical dependency" (CD)
  a failure of few nodes leads only to small damage to the system. So far, the research
  has been focused on interdependent random networks without space limitations. However,
  many real systems, such as power grids and the Internet, are not random but are
  spatially embedded. Here we analytically and numerically analyze the stability of
  systems consisting of interdependent spatially embedded networks modeled as lattice
  networks. Surprisingly, we find that in lattice systems, in contrast to non-embedded
  systems, there is no CD and \textit{any} small fraction of interdependent nodes
  leads to an abrupt collapse. We show that this extreme vulnerability of very weakly
  coupled lattices is a consequence of the critical exponent describing the percolation
  transition of a single lattice. Our results are important for understanding the
  vulnerabilities and for designing robust interdependent spatial embedded networks.
