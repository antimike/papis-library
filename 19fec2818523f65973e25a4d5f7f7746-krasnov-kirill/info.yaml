abstract: 'According to one of many equivalent definitions of twistors a (null) twistor
  is a null geodesic in Minkowski spacetime. Null geodesics can intersect at points
  (events). The idea of Penrose was to think of a spacetime point as a derived concept:
  points are obtained by considering the incidence of twistors. One needs two twistors
  to obtain a point. Twistor is thus a ``square root'''' of a point. In the present
  paper we entertain the idea of quantizing the space of twistors. Twistors, and thus
  also spacetime points become operators acting in a certain Hilbert space. The algebra
  of functions on spacetime becomes an operator algebra. We are therefore led to the
  realm of non-commutative geometry. This non-commutative geometry turns out to be
  related to conformal field theory and holography. Our construction sheds an interesting
  new light on bulk/boundary dualities.'
