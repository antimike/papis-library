abstract: From critical infrastructure, to physiology and the human brain, complex
  systems rarely occur in isolation. Instead, the functioning of nodes in one system
  often promotes or suppresses the functioning of nodes in another. Despite advances
  in structural interdependence, modeling interdependence and other interactions between
  dynamic systems has proven elusive. Here we define a broadly applicable dynamic
  dependency link and develop a general framework for interdependent and competitive
  interactions between general dynamic systems. We apply our framework to studying
  interdependent and competitive synchronization in multi-layer oscillator networks
  and cooperative/competitive contagions in an epidemic model. Using a mean-field
  theory which we verify numerically, we find explosive transitions and rich behavior
  which is absent in percolation models including hysteresis, multi-stability and
  chaos. The framework presented here provides a powerful new way to model and understand
  many of the interacting complex systems which surround us.
