abstract: 'In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes.
  In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy
  between quantum physics and topology: namely, a linear operator behaves very much
  like a "cobordism". Similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they
  represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise
  of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that
  there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation.
  In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept
  of "closed symmetric monoidal category". We assume no prior knowledge of category
  theory, proof theory or computer science.'
