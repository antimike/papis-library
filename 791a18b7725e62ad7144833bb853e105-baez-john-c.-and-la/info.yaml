abstract: This paper traces the growing role of categories and n-categories in physics,
  starting with groups and their role in relativity, and leading up to more sophisticated
  concepts which manifest themselves in Feynman diagrams, spin networks, string theory,
  loop quantum gravity, and topological quantum field theory. Our chronology ends
  around 2000, with just a taste of later developments such as open-closed topological
  string theory, the categorification of quantum groups, Khovanov homology, and Lurie's
  work on the classification of topological quantum field theories.
