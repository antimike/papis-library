abstract: Time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation is solved for type II superconductors
  numerically, and the dynamics of entering vortices, geometric defects and pinning
  effects have been investigated. A superconducting wire with ratchet defects is designed
  to pump the vortices move in a specific direction and enhance the supercurrent when
  applying the periodical magnetic field. Some properties of this wire have been investigated
  numerically and analytically.
