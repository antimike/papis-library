abstract: In this paper we consider a connection between the Moyal formuration of
  quantum mechanics and noncommutative lattices on nonlocal spaces. The Moyal bracket
  generates SU(N) Lie algebras,and representations of these algebras correspond to
  Bratteli diagrams on Hilbert spaces of C*-algebras, and also representations of
  noncommutative lattices on nonlocal spaces correspond to the same diagrams. We will
  show that the quantization thus generates nonlocal spaces by the intermediation
  of Bratteli diagrams.The above connection are investigated in details in two definite
  cases, one is one-dimensional lattice QCD SU(N) fields on the unit circle, the other
  is Penrose lattice SU-type Lie algebra fields on the Penrose lattice.
