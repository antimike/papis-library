abstract: The authors consider the Ginzburg-Landau model for superconductivity. First
  some well-known features of superconducting materials are reviewed and then various
  results concerning the model, the resultant differential equations, and their solution
  on bounded domains are derived. Then, finite element approximations of the solutions
  of the Ginzburg-Landau equations are considered and error estimates of optimal order
  are derived.
