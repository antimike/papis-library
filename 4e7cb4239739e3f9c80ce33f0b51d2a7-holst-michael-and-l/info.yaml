abstract: Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) was developed by Arnold, Falk, Winther
  and others over the last decade to exploit the observation that mixed variational
  problems can be posed on a Hilbert complex, and Galerkin-type mixed methods can
  then be obtained by solving finite-dimensional subcomplex problems. Chen, Holst,
  and Xu (Math. Comp. 78 (2009) 35-53) established convergence and optimality of an
  adaptive mixed finite element method using Raviart-Thomas or Brezzi-Douglas-Marini
  elements for Poisson's equation on contractible domains in two dimensions, which
  can be viewed as a boundary problem on the de Rham complex. Recently Demlow and
  Hirani (Found. Math. Comput. 14 (2014) 1337-1371) developed fundamental tools for
  a posteriori analysis on the de Rham complex. In this paper, we use tools in FEEC
  to construct convergence and complexity results on domains with general topology
  and spatial dimension. In particular, we construct a reliable and efficient error
  estimator and a sharper quasi-orthogonality result using a novel technique. Without
  marking for data oscillation, our adaptive method is a contraction with respect
  to a total error incorporating the error estimator and data oscillation.
