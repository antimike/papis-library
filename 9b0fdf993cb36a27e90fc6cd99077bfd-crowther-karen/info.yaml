abstract: Quantum gravity is understood as a theory that, in some sense, unifies general
  relativity (GR) and quantum theory, and is supposed to replace GR at extremely small
  distances (high-energies). It may be that quantum gravity represents the breakdown
  of spacetime geometry described by GR. The relationship between quantum gravity
  and spacetime has been deemed "emergence", and the aim of this thesis is to investigate
  and explicate this relation. After finding traditional philosophical accounts of
  emergence to be inappropriate, I develop a new conception of emergence by considering
  physical case studies including condensed matter physics, hydrodynamics, critical
  phenomena and quantum field theory understood as effective field theory.   This
  new conception of emergence is independent of reduction and derivation. Instead,
  a low-energy theory is understood as emergent from a high-energy theory if it is
  novel and autonomous compared to the high-energy theory, and the low-energy physics
  is dependent (in a particular, minimal sense) on the high-energy physics (this dependence
  is revealed by the techniques of effective field theory and the renormalisation
  group). These ideas are important in exploring the relationship between quantum
  gravity and GR, where GR is understood as an effective, low-energy theory of quantum
  gravity. Without experimental data or a theory of quantum gravity, we rely on principles
  and techniques from other areas of physics to guide the way. As well as considering
  the idea of emergence appropriate to treating GR as an effective field theory, I
  investigate the emergence of spacetime (and other aspects of GR) in several concrete
  approaches to quantum gravity, including examples of the condensed matter approaches,
  the "discrete approaches" (causal set theory, causal dynamical triangulations, quantum
  causal histories and quantum graphity) and loop quantum gravity.
