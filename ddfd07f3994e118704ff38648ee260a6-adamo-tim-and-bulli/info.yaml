abstract: 'This article reviews the recent progress in twistor approaches to Wilson
  loops, amplitudes and their duality for N=4 super Yang-Mills. Wilson loops and amplitudes
  are derived from first principles using the twistor action for maximally supersymmetric
  Yang-Mills theory. We start by deriving the MHV rules for gauge theory amplitudes
  from the twistor action in an axial gauge in twistor space, and show that this gives
  rise to the original momentum space version given by Cachazo, Svrcek and Witten.
  We then go on to obtain from these the construction of the momentum twistor space
  loop integrand using (planar) MHV rules and show how it arises as the expectation
  value of a holomorphic Wilson loop in twistor space. We explain the connection between
  the holomorphic Wilson loop and certain light-cone limits of correlation functions.
  We give a brief review of other ideas in connection with amplitudes in twistor space:
  twistor-strings, recursion in twistor space, the Grassmannian residue formula for
  leading singularities and amplitudes as polytopes. This article is an invited review
  for a special issue of Journal of Physics A devoted to `Scattering Amplitudes in
  Gauge Theories''.'
