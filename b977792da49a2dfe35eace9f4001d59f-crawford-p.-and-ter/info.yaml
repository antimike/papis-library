abstract: To resolve some unphysical interpretations related to velocity measurements
  by static observers, we discuss the use of generalized observer sets, give a prescription
  for defining the speed of test particles relative to those observers and show that,
  for any locally inertial frame, the speed of a freely falling material particle
  is always less than the speed of light at the Schwarzschild black hole surface.
