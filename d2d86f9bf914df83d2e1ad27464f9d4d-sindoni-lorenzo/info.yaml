abstract: We give a critical overview of various attempts to describe gravity as an
  emergent phenomenon, starting from examples of condensed matter physics, to arrive
  to more sophisticated pregeometric models. The common line of thought is to view
  the graviton as a composite particle/collective mode. However, we will describe
  many different ways in which this idea is realized in practice.
