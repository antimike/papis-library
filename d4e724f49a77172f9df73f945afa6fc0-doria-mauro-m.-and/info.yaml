abstract: The vortex state of mesoscopic three-dimensional superconductors is determined
  using a minimization procedure of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy. We obtain the
  vortex pattern for a mesoscopic superconducting sphere and find that vortex lines
  are naturally bent and are closest to each other at the equatorial plane. For a
  superconducting disk with finite height, and under an applied magnetic field perpendicular
  to its major surface, we find that our method gives results consistent with previous
  calculations. The matching fields, the magnetization and Hc3, are obtained for models
  that differ according to their boundary properties. A change of the Ginzburg-Landau
  parameters near the surface can substantially enhance Hc3, as shown here. Â© 2007
