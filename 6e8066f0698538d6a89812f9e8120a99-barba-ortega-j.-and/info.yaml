abstract: The time dependent GinzburgLandau equations (TDGLE) are used to study the
  superconducting properties of a disk by taking into account the influence of internal
  defects. The Link variable algorithm is applied to a circular geometry surrounded
  by an insulator and immersed in an external magnetic field applied perpendicular
  to its plane. The TDGLE are used upon taking the magnetic field and the order parameter
  invariant along z-direction. We show that the magnetic response is substantially
  modified by the competition between the confinement geometry and the geometric position
  of the defects leads to vortex configurations which are not compatible with the
  symmetry of the sample geometry. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
