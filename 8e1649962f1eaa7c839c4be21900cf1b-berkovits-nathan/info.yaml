abstract: Mason and Skinner recently constructed a chiral infinite tension limit of
  the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz superstring which was shown to compute the Cachazo-He-Yuan
  formulae for tree-level d=10 Yang-Mills amplitudes and the NS-NS sector of tree-level
  d=10 supergravity amplitudes. In this letter, their chiral infinite tension limit
  is generalized to the pure spinor superstring which computes a d=10 superspace version
  of the Cachazo-He-Yuan formulae for tree-level d=10 super-Yang-Mills and supergravity
  amplitudes.
