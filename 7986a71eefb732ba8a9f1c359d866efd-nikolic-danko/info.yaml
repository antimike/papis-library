abstract: The mind is a biological phenomenon. Thus, biological principles of organization
  should also be the principles underlying mental operations. Practopoiesis states
  that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation is an arrangement in
  which mechanisms laying at a lower level of organization, by their operations and
  interaction with the environment, enable creation of mechanisms laying at a higher
  level of organization. When such an organizational advance of a system occurs, it
  is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when plasticity mechanisms (at a lower
  level of organization), by their operations, create a neural network anatomy (at
  a higher level of organization). Another case is the actual production of behavior
  by that network, whereby the mechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor
  actions. Practopoietic theory explains why the adaptability of a system increases
  with each increase in the number of traverses. With a larger number of traverses,
  a system can be relatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent
  behavior than a system with a lower number of traverses. The present analyses indicate
  that the two well-known traverses neural plasticity and neural activity are not
  sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one additional traverse
  is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution in reconstructing knowledge
  e.g., from long-term memory into working memory. The conclusions bear implications
  for brain theory, the mindbody explanatory gap, and developments of artificial intelligence
  technologies.
