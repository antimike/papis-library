abstract: Many biological and man-made networked systems are characterized by the
  simultaneous presence of different sub-networks organized in separate layers, with
  links and nodes of qualitatively different types. While during the past few years
  theoretical studies have examined a variety of structural features of complex networks,
  the outstanding question is whether such features are characterizing all single
  layers, or rather emerge as a result of coarse-graining, i.e. when going from the
  multilayered to the aggregate network representation. Here we address this issue
  with the help of real data. We analyze the structural properties of an intrinsically
  multilayered real network, the European Air Transportation Multiplex Network in
  which each commercial airline defines a network layer. We examine how several structural
  measures evolve as layers are progressively merged together. In particular, we discuss
  how the topology of each layer affects the emergence of structural properties in
  the aggregate network.
