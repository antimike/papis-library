abstract: We study the transient dynamics of an $A+B \rightarrow 0$ process on a pair
  of randomly coupled networks, where reactants are initially separated. We find that,
  for sufficiently small fractions $q$ of cross-couplings, the concentration of $A$
  (or $B$) particles decays linearly in a first stage and crosses over to a second
  linear decrease at a mixing time $t_x$. By numerical and analytical arguments, we
  show that for symmetric and homogeneous structures $t_x\propto(\nicefrac{\langle
  k \rangle}{q})\log(\nicefrac{\langle k \rangle}{q})$ where $\langle k \rangle$ is
  the mean degree of both networks. Being this behavior in marked contrast with a
  purely diffusive process---where the mixing time would go simply like $\langle k\rangle/q$---we
  identify the logarithmic slowing down in $t_x$ to be the result of a novel spontaneous
  mechanism of {\em repulsion} between the reactants $A$ and $B$ due to the interactions
  taking place at the networks' interface. We show numerically how this spontaneous
  repulsion effect depends on the topology of the underlying networks.
