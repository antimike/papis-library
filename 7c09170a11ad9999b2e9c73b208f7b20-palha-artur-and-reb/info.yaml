abstract: This paper introduces the basic concepts for physics-compatible discretization
  techniques. The paper gives a clear distinction between vectors and forms. Based
  on the difference between forms and pseudo-forms and the $\star$-operator which
  switches between the two, a dual grid description and a single grid description
  are presented. The dual grid method resembles a staggered finite volume method,
  whereas the single grid approach shows a strong resemblance with a finite element
  method. Both approaches are compared for the Poisson equation for volume forms.
