abstract: Trust and reputation systems represent a significant trend in decision support
  for Internet mediated service provision. The basic idea is to let parties rate each
  other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated
  ratings about a given party to derive a trust or reputation score, which can assist
  other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with that party in the future.
  A natural side effect is that it also provides an incentive for good behaviour,
  and therefore tends to have a positive effect on market quality. Reputation systems
  can be called collaborative sanctioning systems to reflect their collaborative nature,
  and are related to collaborative filtering systems. Reputation systems are already
  being used in successful commercial online applications. There is also a rapidly
  growing literature around trust and reputation systems, but unfortunately this activity
  is not very coherent. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of existing
  and proposed systems that can be used to derive measures of trust and reputation
  for Internet transactions, to analyse the current trends and developments in this
  area, and to propose a research agenda for trust and reputation systems.
