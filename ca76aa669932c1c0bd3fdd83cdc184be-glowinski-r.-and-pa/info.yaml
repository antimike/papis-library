abstract: A new Lagrange-multiplier based fictitious-domain method is presented for
  the direct numerical simulation of viscous incompressible flow with suspended solid
  particles. The method uses a finite-element discretization in space and an operator-splitting
  technique for discretization in time. The linearly constrained quadratic minimization
  problems which arise from this splitting are solved using conjugate-gradient algorithms.
  A key feature of the method is that the fluid–particle motion is treated implicitly
  via a combined weak formulation in which the mutual forces cancel—explicit calculation
  of the hydrodynamic forces and torques on the particles is not required. The fluid
  flow equations are enforced inside, as well as outside, the particle boundaries.
  The flow inside, and on, each particle boundary is constrained to be a rigid-body
  motion using a distributed Lagrange multiplier. This multiplier represents the additional
  body force per unit volume needed to maintain the rigid-body motion inside the particle
  boundary, and is analogous to the pressure in incompressible fluid flow, whose gradient
  is the force required to maintain the constraint of incompressibility. The method
  is validated using the sedimentation of two circular particles in a two-dimensional
  channel as the test problem, and is then applied to the sedimentation of 504 circular
  particles in a closed two-dimensional box. The resulting suspension is fairly dense,
  and the computation could not be carried out without an effective strategy for preventing
  particles from penetrating each other or the solid outer walls; in the method described
  herein, this is achieved by activating a repelling force on close approach, such
  as might occur as a consequence of roughness elements on the particle. The development
  of physically based mathematical methods for avoiding particle–particle and particle–wall
  penetration is a new problem posed by the direct simulation of fluidized suspensions.
  The simulation starts with the particles packed densely at the top of the sedimentation
  column. In the course of their fall to the bottom of the box, a fingering motion
  of the particles, which are heavier than the surrounding fluid, develops in a way
  reminiscent of the familiar dynamics associated with the Rayleigh–Taylor instability
  of heavy fluid above light. We also present here the results of a three-dimensional
  simulation of the sedimentation of two spherical particles. The simulation reproduces
  the familiar dynamics of drafting, kissing and tumbling to side-by-side motion with
  the line between centers across the flow at Reynolds numbers in the hundreds.
