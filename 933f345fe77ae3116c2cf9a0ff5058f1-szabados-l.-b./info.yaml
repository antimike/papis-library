abstract: The two dimensional version of the Sen connection for spinors and tensors
  on spacelike 2-surfaces is constructed. A complex metric $\gamma_{AB}$ on the spin
  spaces is found which characterizes both the algebraic and extrinsic geometrical
  properties of the 2-surface $\$ $. The curvature of the two dimensional Sen operator
  $\Delta_e$ is the pull back to $\$ $ of the anti-self-dual part of the spacetime
  curvature while its `torsion' is a boost gauge invariant expression of the extrinsic
  curvatures of $\$ $. The difference of the 2 dimensional Sen and the induced spin
  connections is the anti-self-dual part of the `torsion'. The irreducible parts of
  $\Delta_e$ are shown to be the familiar 2-surface twistor and the Weyl--Sen--Witten
  operators. Two Sen--Witten type identities are derived, the first is an identity
  between the 2 dimensional twistor and the Weyl--Sen--Witten operators and the integrand
  of Penrose's charge integral, while the second contains the `torsion' as well. For
  spinor fields satisfying the 2-surface twistor equation the first reduces to Tod's
  formula for the kinematical twistor.
