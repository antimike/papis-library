abstract: We introduce a quantum Minkowski space-time based on the quantum group SU(2)q
  extended by a degree operator and formulate a quantum version of the anti-self-dual
  Yang-Mills equation. We construct solutions of the quantum equations using the classical
  ADHM linear data, and conjecture that, up to gauge transformations, our construction
  yields all the solutions. We also find a deformation of Penrose's twistor diagram,
  giving a correspondence between the quantum Minkowski space-time and the classical
  projective twistor space.
