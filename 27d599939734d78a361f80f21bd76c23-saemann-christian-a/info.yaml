abstract: We establish a Penrose-Ward transform yielding a bijection between holomorphic
  principal 2-bundles over a twistor space and non-Abelian self-dual tensor fields
  on six-dimensional flat space-time. Extending the twistor space to supertwistor
  space, we derive sets of manifestly N=(1,0) and N=(2,0) supersymmetric non-Abelian
  constraint equations containing the tensor multiplet. We also demonstrate how this
  construction leads to constraint equations for non-Abelian supersymmetric self-dual
  strings.
