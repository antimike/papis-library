abstract: I define a statistical model of graphs in which 2-dimensional spaces arise
  at low temperature. The configurations are given by graphs with a fixed number of
  edges and the Hamiltonian is a simple, local function of the graphs. Simulations
  show that there is a transition between a low-temperature regime in which the graphs
  form triangulations of 2-dimensional surfaces and a high-temperature regime, where
  the surfaces disappear. I use data for the specific heat and other observables to
  discuss whether this is a phase transition. The surface states are analyzed with
  regard to topology and defects.
