abstract: I analyze the lattice simulation data of the Domain Wall Fermion in quaternion
  basis. As pointed out by Atiyah and Ward, the minimum action solution for SU(2)
  Yang-Mills fields in Euclidean 4-space correspond, via Penrose twistor transform,
  to algebraic bundles on the complex projective 3-space. Assuming dominance of correlation
  between the fermions on the domain walls via exchange of instantons, I extract parameters
  necessary for defining gauge fields of Atiyah-Ward ansatz. The QCD effective coupling
  in the infrared and the relation between the number of flavors and the infrared
  fixed point is investigated.   Consequence of this lepton flavor assignment to phenomenology
  of baryons is also discussed.
