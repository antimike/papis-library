abstract: We provide a brief overview on the application of the exterior calculus
  of differential forms to the ab initio formulation of field theories on random simplicial
  lattices. In this framework, discrete analogues of the exterior derivative and the
  Hodge star operator are employed for the factorization of discrete field equations
  into a purely combinatorial (metric-free) part and a metric-dependent part. The
  Hodge star duality (isomorphism) is invoked to motivate the use of primal and dual
  lattices (a dual cell complex). The natural role of Whitney forms in the construction
  of discrete Hodge star operators is stressed.
