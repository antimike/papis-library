abstract: We explore a differential calculus on the algebra of smooth functions on
  a manifold. The former is `noncommutative' in the sense that functions and differentials
  do not commute, in general. Relations with bicovariant differential calculus on
  certain quantum groups and stochastic calculus are discussed. A similar differential
  calculus on a superspace is shown to be related to the Batalin-Vilkovisky antifield
  formalism.
