abstract: Systems that comprise many interacting dynamical networks, such as the human
  body with its biological networks or the global economic network consisting of regional
  clusters, often exhibit complicated collective dynamics. To understand the collective
  behavior of such systems, we investigate a model of interacting networks exhibiting
  the fundamental processes of failure, damage spread, and recovery. We find a very
  rich phase diagram that becomes exponentially more complex as the number of networks
  is increased. In the simplest example of $n=2$ interacting networks we find two
  critical points, 4 triple points, 10 allowed transitions, and two "forbidden" transitions,
  as well as complex hysteresis loops. Remarkably, we find that triple points play
  the dominant role in constructing the optimal repairing strategy in damaged interacting
  systems. To support our model, we analyze an example of real interacting financial
  networks and find evidence of rapid dynamical transitions between well-defined states,
  in agreement with the predictions of our model.
