abstract: Eigenfunctions of total angular momentum for a charged vector field interacting
  with a magnetic monopole are constructed and their properties studied. In general,
  these eigenfunctions can be obtained by applying vector operators to the monopole
  spherical harmonics in a manner similar to that often used for the construction
  of the ordinary vector spherical harmonics. This construction fails for the harmonics
  with the minimum allowed angular momentum. These latter form a set of vector fields
  with vanishing covariant curl and covariant divergence, whose number can be determined
  by an index theorem.
