abstract: Quantum Graphity is an approach to quantum gravity based on a background
  independent formulation of condensed matter systems on graphs. We summarize recent
  results obtained on the notion of emergent geometry from the point of view of a
  particle hopping on the graph. We discuss the role of connectivity in emergent Lorentzian
  perturbations in a curved background and the Bose--Hubbard (BH) model defined on
  graphs with particular symmetries.
