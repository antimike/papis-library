abstract: Finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) has been developed over the past
  decade as a framework for constructing and analyzing stable and accurate numerical
  methods for partial differential equations by employing differential complexes.
  The recent work of Arnold, Falk and Winther \cite{ArFaWi2010} includes a well-developed
  theory of finite element methods for Hodge Laplace problems, including a priori
  error estimates. In this work we focus on developing a posteriori error estimates
  in which the computational error is bounded by some computable functional of the
  discrete solution and problem data. More precisely, we prove a posteriori error
  estimates of residual type for Arnold-Falk-Winther mixed finite element methods
  for Hodge-de Rham Laplace problems. While a number of previous works consider a
  posteriori error estimation for Maxwell's equations and mixed formulations of the
  scalar Laplacian, the approach we take is distinguished by unified treatment of
  the various Hodge Laplace problems arising in the de Rham complex, consistent use
  of the language and analytical framework of differential forms, and the development
  of a posteriori error estimates for harmonic forms and the effects of their approximation
  on the resulting numerical method for the Hodge Laplacian.
