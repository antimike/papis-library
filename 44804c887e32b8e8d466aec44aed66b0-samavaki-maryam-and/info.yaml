abstract: We study properties of the solutions to Navier-Stokes system on compact
  Riemannian manifolds. The motivation for such a formulation comes from atmospheric
  models as well as some thin film flows on curved surfaces. There are different choices
  of the diffusion operator which have been used in previous studies, and we make
  a few comments why the choice adopted below seems to us the correct one. This choice
  leads to the conclusion that Killing vector fields are essential in analyzing the
  qualitative properties of the flow. We give several results illustrating this and
  analyze also the linearized version of Navier-Stokes system which is interesting
  in numerical applications. Finally we consider the 2 dimensional case which has
  specific characteristics, and treat also the Coriolis effect which is essential
  in atmospheric flows.
