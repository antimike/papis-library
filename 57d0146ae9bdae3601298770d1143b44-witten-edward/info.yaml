abstract: Perturbative scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory have many unexpected
  properties, such as holomorphy of the maximally helicity violating amplitudes. To
  interpret these results, we Fourier transform the scattering amplitudes from momentum
  space to twistor space, and argue that the transformed amplitudes are supported
  on certain holomorphic curves. This in turn is apparently a consequence of an equivalence
  between the perturbative expansion of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory and the
  $D$-instanton expansion of a certain string theory, namely the topological $B$ model
  whose target space is the Calabi-Yau supermanifold $\Bbb{CP}^{3|4}$.
