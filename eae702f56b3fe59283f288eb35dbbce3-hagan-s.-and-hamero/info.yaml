abstract: 'The Penrose-Hameroff (`Orch OR'') model of quantum computation in brain
  microtubules has been criticized as regards the issue of environmental decoherence.
  A recent report by Tegmark finds that microtubules can maintain quantum coherence
  for only $10^{-13}$ s, far too short to be neurophysiologically relevant. Here,
  we critically examine the assumptions behind Tegmark''s calculation and find that:
  1) Tegmark''s commentary is not aimed at an existing model in the literature but
  rather at a hybrid that replaces the superposed protein conformations of the `Orch
  OR'' theory with a soliton in superposition along the microtubule, 2) Tegmark predicts
  decreasing decoherence times at lower temperature, in direct contradiction of the
  observed behavior of quantum states, 3) recalculation after correcting Tegmark''s
  equation for differences between his model and the `Orch OR'' model (superposition
  separation, charge vs. dipole, dielectric constant) lengthens the decoherence time
  to $10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ s and invalidates a critical assumption of Tegmark''s derivation,
  4) incoherent metabolic energy supplied to the collective dynamics ordering water
  in the vicinity of microtubules at a rate exceeding that of decoherence can counter
  decoherence effects (in the same way that lasers avoid decoherence at room temperature),
  and 5) phases of actin gelation may enhance the ordering of water around microtubule
  bundles, further increasing the decoherence-free zone by an order of magnitude and
  the decoherence time to $10^{-2} - 10^{-1}$ s. These revisions bring microtubule
  decoherence into a regime in which quantum gravity can interact with neurophysiology.'
