abstract: Huygens triviality-a concept invented by Jacques Hadamard-describes an equivalence
  class connecting those 2nd order partial differential equations which are transformable
  into the wave equation. In this work it is demonstrated, that the Schr\"odinger
  equation with the time-independent Hamiltonian belongs to such an equivalence class.
  The wave equation is the equation for which Huygens' principle (HP) holds. The HP
  was a subject of confusion in both physics and mathematics literature for a long
  time. Not surprisingly, the role of this principle was obscured from the beginnings
  of quantum mechanics causing some theoretical and experimental misunderstandings.
  The purpose of this work is to bring the full clarity into this topic. By doing
  so, we obtained a large amount of new results related to uses of Lie sphere geometry,
  of twistors, of Dupin cyclides, of null electromagnetic fields, of AdS-CFT correspondence,
  of Penrose limits, of geometric algebra, etc. in physical problems ranging from
  the atomic to high energy physics and cosmology.
