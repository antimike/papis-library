abstract: 'Identifying key players in collective dynamics remains a challenge in several
  research fields, from the efficient dissemination of ideas to drug target discovery
  in biomedical problems. The difficulty lies at several levels: how to single out
  the role of individual elements in such intermingled systems, or which is the best
  way to quantify their importance. Centrality measures describe a node''s importance
  by its position in a network. The key issue obviated is that the contribution of
  a node to the collective behavior is not uniquely determined by the structure of
  the system but it is a result of the interplay between dynamics and network structure.
  We show that dynamical influence measures explicitly how strongly a node''s dynamical
  state affects collective behavior. For critical spreading, dynamical influence targets
  nodes according to their spreading capabilities. For diffusive processes it quantifies
  how efficiently real systems may be controlled by manipulating a single node.'
