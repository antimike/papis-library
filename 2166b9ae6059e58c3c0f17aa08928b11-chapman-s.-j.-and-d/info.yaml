abstract: A model for superconductivity in thin films having variable thickness is
  derived through an averaging process across the film. When the film is of uniform
  thickness the model is identical to a model for superconducting cylinders as the
  Ginzburg-Landau parameter tends to âˆž. This means that all superconducting materials,
  whether type I or type II in bulk, behave as type-II superconductors when made into
  sufficiently thin films. When the film is of non-uniform thickness the variations
  in thickness appear as spatially varying coefficients in the thin-film differential
  equations. After providing a formal derivation of the model, some results about
  solutions of the variable thickness model are given. In particular, it is shown
  that solutions obtained from the new model are an appropriate limit of a sequence
  of averages of solutions of the three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model as the thickness
  of the film tends to zero. An application of the variable thickness thin film model
  to flux pinning is then provided. In particular, the results of a numerical calculation
  are given that show that the vortex-like structures present in superconductors are
  attracted to relatively thin regions.
