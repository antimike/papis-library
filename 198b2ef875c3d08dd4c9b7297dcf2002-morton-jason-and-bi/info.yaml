abstract: Recent work has examined how undecidable problems can arise in quantum information
  science. We augment this by introducing three new undecidable problems stated in
  terms of tensor networks. These relate to ideas of Penrose about the physicality
  of a spin-network representing a physical process, closed timelike curves, and Boolean
  relation theory. Seemingly slight modifications of the constraints on the topology
  or the tensor families generating the networks leads to problems that transition
  from decidable, to undecidable to even always satisfiable.
