abstract: The entanglement entropy has been historically studied by many authors in
  order to obtain quantum mechanical interpretations of the gravitational entropy.
  The discovery of AdS/CFT correspondence leads to the idea of holographic entanglement
  entropy, which is a clear solution to this important problem in gravity. In this
  article, we would like to give a quick survey of recent progresses on the holographic
  entanglement entropy. We focus on its gravitational aspects, so that it is comprehensible
  to those who are familiar with general relativity and basics of quantum field theory.
