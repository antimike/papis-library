abstract: We propose a geometrical approach to the investigation of Hamiltonian systems
  on (Pseudo) Riemannian manifolds. A new geometrical criterion of instability and
  chaos is proposed. This approach is more generic than well known reduction to the
  geodesic flow. It is applicable to various astrophysical and cosmological problems.
