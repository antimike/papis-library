abstract: <jats:p>Finite element exterior calculus is an approach to the design and
  understanding of finite element discretizations for a wide variety of systems of
  partial differential equations. This approach brings to bear tools from differential
  geometry, algebraic topology, and homological algebra to develop discretizations
  which are compatible with the geometric, topological, and algebraic structures which
  underlie well-posedness of the PDE problem being solved. In the finite element exterior
  calculus, many finite element spaces are revealed as spaces of piecewise polynomial
  differential forms. These connect to each other in discrete subcomplexes of elliptic
  differential complexes, and are also related to the continuous elliptic complex
  through projections which commute with the complex differential. Applications are
  made to the finite element discretization of a variety of problems, including the
  Hodge Laplacian, Maxwellâ€™s equations, the equations of elasticity, and elliptic
  eigenvalue problems, and also to preconditioners.</jats:p>
