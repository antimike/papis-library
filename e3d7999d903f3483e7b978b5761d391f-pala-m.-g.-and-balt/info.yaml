abstract: We present evidence for a counter-intuitive behavior of semiconductor mesoscopic
  networks that is the analog of the Braess paradox encountered in classical networks.
  A numerical simulation of quantum transport in a two-branch mesoscopic network reveals
  that adding a third branch can paradoxically induce transport inefficiency that
  manifests itself in a sizable conductance drop of the network. A scanning-probe
  experiment using a biased tip to modulate the transmission of one branch in the
  network reveals the occurrence of this paradox by mapping the conductance variation
  as a function of the tip voltage and position.
