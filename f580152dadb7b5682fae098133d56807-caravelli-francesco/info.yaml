abstract: We present a mapping of dynamical graphs and, in particular, the graphs
  used in the Quantum Graphity models for emergent geometry, into an Ising hamiltonian
  on the line graph of a complete graph with a fixed number of vertices. We use this
  method to study the properties of Quantum Graphity models at low temperature in
  the limit in which the valence coupling constant of the model is much greater than
  the coupling constants of the loop terms. Using mean field theory we find that an
  order parameter for the model is the average valence of the graph. We calculate
  the equilibrium distribution for the valence as an implicit function of the temperature.
  In the approximation in which the temperature is low, we find the first two Taylor
  coefficients of the valence in the temperature expansion. A discussion of the susceptibility
  function and a generalization of the model are given in the end.
