abstract: 'We propose a simple scenario which explains why our Universe appears spatially
  flat, homogeneous and isotropic. We use the Einstein-Cartan-Kibble-Sciama (ECKS)
  theory of gravity which naturally extends general relativity to include the spin
  of matter. The torsion of spacetime generates gravitational repulsion in the early
  Universe filled with quarks and leptons, preventing the cosmological singularity:
  the Universe expands from a state of minimum but finite radius. We show that the
  dynamics of the closed Universe immediately after this state naturally solves the
  flatness and horizon problems in cosmology because of an extremely small and negative
  torsion density parameter, $\Omega_S \approx -10^{-69}$. Thus the ECKS gravity provides
  a compelling alternative to speculative mechanisms of standard cosmic inflation.
  This scenario also suggests that the contraction of our Universe preceding the bounce
  at the minimum radius may correspond to the dynamics of matter inside a collapsing
  black hole existing in another universe, which could explain the origin of the Big
  Bang.'
