abstract: The scattering equations on the Riemann sphere give rise to remarkable formulae
  for tree-level gauge theory and gravity amplitudes. Adamo, Casali and Skinner conjectured
  a one-loop formula for supergravity amplitudes based on scattering equations on
  a torus. We use a residue theorem to transform this into a formula on the Riemann
  sphere. What emerges is a framework for loop integrands on the Riemann sphere that
  promises to have wide application, based on off-shell scattering equations that
  depend on the loop momentum. We present new formulae, checked explicitly at low
  points, for supergravity and super-Yang-Mills amplitudes and for n-gon integrands
  at one loop. Finally, we show that the off-shell scattering equations naturally
  extend to arbitrary loop order, and we give a proposal for the all-loop integrands
  for supergravity and planar super-Yang-Mills theory.
