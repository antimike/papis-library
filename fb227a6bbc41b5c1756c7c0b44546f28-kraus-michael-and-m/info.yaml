abstract: Variational integrators for Lagrangian dynamical systems provide a systematic
  way to derive geometric numerical methods. These methods preserve a discrete multisymplectic
  form as well as momenta associated to symmetries of the Lagrangian via Noether's
  theorem. An inevitable prerequisite for the derivation of variational integrators
  is the existence of a variational formulation for the considered problem. Even though
  for a large class of systems this requirement is fulfilled, there are many interesting
  examples which do not belong to this class, e.g., equations of advection-diffusion
  type frequently encountered in fluid dynamics or plasma physics. On the other hand,
  it is always possible to embed an arbitrary dynamical system into a larger Lagrangian
  system using the method of formal (or adjoint) Lagrangians. We investigate the application
  of the variational integrator method to formal Lagrangians, and thereby extend the
  application domain of variational integrators to include potentially all dynamical
  systems. The theory is supported by physically relevant examples, such as the advection
  equation and the vorticity equation, and numerically verified. Remarkably, the integrator
  for the vorticity equation combines Arakawa's discretisation of the Poisson brackets
  with a symplectic time stepping scheme in a fully covariant way such that the discrete
  energy is exactly preserved. In the presentation of the results, we try to make
  the geometric framework of variational integrators accessible to non specialists.
