abstract: With the help of the Penrose-Ward transform, which relates certain holomorphic
  vector bundles over the supertwistor space to the equations of motion of self-dual
  SYM theory in four dimensions, we construct hidden infinite-dimensional symmetries
  of the theory. We also present a new and shorter proof (cf. hep-th/0412163) of the
  relation between certain deformation algebras and hidden symmetry algebras. This
  article is based on a talk given by the author at the Workshop on Supersymmetries
  and Quantum Symmetries 2005 at the BLTP in Dubna, Russia.
