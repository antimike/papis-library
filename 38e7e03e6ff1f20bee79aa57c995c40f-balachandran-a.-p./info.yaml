abstract: Lattice discretizations of continuous manifolds are common tools used in
  a variety of physical contexts. Conventional discrete approximations, however, cannot
  capture all aspects of the original manifold, notably its topology. In this paper
  we discuss an approximation scheme due to Sorkin which correctly reproduces important
  topological aspects of continuum physics. The approximating topological spaces are
  partially ordered sets (posets), the partial order encoding the topology. Now, the
  topology of a manifold $M$ can be reconstructed from the commutative C*-algebra
  $\cc(M)$ of continuous functions defined on it. In turn, this algebra is generated
  by continuous probability densities in ordinary quantum physics on $M$. The latter
  also serve to specify the domains of observables like the Hamiltonian. For a poset,
  the role of this algebra is assumed by a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra $\ca $. This
  fact makes any poset a genuine `noncommutative' (`quantum') space, in the sense
  that the algebra of its `continuous functions' is a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra.
  We therefore also have a remarkable connection between finite approximations to
  quantum physics and noncommutative geometries. We use this connection to develop
  various approximation methods for doing quantum physics using $\ca$.
