abstract: Many systems, ranging from engineering to medical to societal, can only
  be properly characterized by multiple interdependent networks whose normal functioning
  depends on one another. Failure of a fraction of nodes in one network may lead to
  a failure in another network. This in turn may cause further malfunction of additional
  nodes in the first network and so on. Such a cascade of failures, triggered by a
  failure of a small faction of nodes in only one network, may lead to the complete
  fragmentation of all networks. We introduce a model and an analytical framework
  for studying interdependent networks. We obtain interesting and surprising results
  that should significantly effect the design of robust real-world networks. For two
  interdependent Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, we find that the critical average degree
  below which both networks collapse is <k_c>=2.445, compared to <k_c>=1 for a single
  ER network. Furthermore, while for a single network a broader degree distribution
  of the network nodes results in higher robustness to random failure, for interdependent
  networks, the broader the distribution is, the more vulnerable the networks become
  to random failure.
