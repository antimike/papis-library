abstract: 'In this paper we develop an analytical and graphical formulation of the
  constructal law of maximization of flow access in systems with heat and fluid flow
  irreversibilities and freedom to change configuration. The flow system has global
  performance (e.g., minimization of global flow resistance) and global properties,
  or constraints (e.g., overall size, and total duct volume). The infinity of possible
  flow structures occupies a region of the two-dimensional domain of “global performance
  versus freedom to morph”. This region of “nonequilibrium flow structures” is bounded
  by a line representing the best flow structures that are possible when the freedom
  to morph is limited. The best of all such structures are the “equilibrium flow structures”:
  here the performance level is the highest, and it does not change even though the
  flow architecture can change with maximum freedom. The universality of this graphical
  and analytical presentation is illustrated with examples of flow structures from
  three classes: flow between two points, flow between a circle and its center, and
  flow between one point and an area. In sum, this paper presents an analytical and
  graphical formulation of the constructal principle of generation of flow architecture.
  The place of this new and self-standing principle in the greater framework of thermodynamics
  is outlined.'
