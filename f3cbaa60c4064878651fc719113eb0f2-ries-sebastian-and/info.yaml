abstract: The evaluation of the trustworthiness of complex systems is a challenge
  in current IT research. We contribute to this field by providing a novel model for
  the evaluation of propositional logic terms under uncertainty that is compliant
  with the standard probabilistic approach and subjective logic. Furthermore, we present
  a use case to demonstrate how this approach can be applied to the evaluation of
  the trustworthiness of a system based on the knowledge about its components and
  subsystems.
