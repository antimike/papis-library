annote: 'For many physicists quantum theory contains strong conceptual difficulties,
  while for others the apparent conclusions about the reality of our physical world
  and the ways in which we discover that reality remain philosophically unacceptable.This
  book focuses on recent theoretical and experimental developments in the foundations
  of quantum physics, including topics such as the puzzles and paradoxes which appear
  when general relativity and quantum mechanics are combined; the emergence of classical
  properties from quantum mechanics; stochastic electrodynamics; EPR experiments and
  Bell''s Theorem; the consistent histories approach and the problem of datum uniqueness
  in quantum mechanics; non-local measurements and teleportation of quantum states;
  quantum non-demolition measurements in optics and matter wave properties observed
  by neutron, electron and atomic interferometry.Audience: This volume is intended
  for graduate students of physics and those interested in the foundations of quantum
  theory.'
