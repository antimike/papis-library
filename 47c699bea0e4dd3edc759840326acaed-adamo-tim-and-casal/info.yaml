abstract: Ambitwistor strings are chiral, infinite tension analogues of conventional
  string theory whose target space is the space of complex null geodesics and whose
  spectrum consists exclusively of massless states. At genus zero, these strings underpin
  the Cachazo-He-Yuan formulae for tree level scattering of gravitons, gluons and
  scalars. In this paper we extend these formulae in a number of directions. Firstly,
  we consider Ramond sector vertex operators and construct simple amplitudes involving
  space-time fermions. These agree with tree amplitudes in ten dimensional supergravity
  and super Yang--Mills. We then show that, after the usual GSO projections, the ambitwistor
  string partition function is modular invariant. We consider the scattering equations
  at genus one, and calculate one loop scattering amplitudes for NS-NS external states
  in the Type II ambitwistor string. We conjecture that these give new representations
  of (the integrand of) one loop supergravity amplitudes and we show that they have
  the expected behaviour under factorization of the worldsheet in both non--separating
  and separating degenerations.
