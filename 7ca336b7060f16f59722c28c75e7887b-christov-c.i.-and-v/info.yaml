abstract: 'A generalization of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdVE) is considered
  in which additional terms belonging to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) are
  incorporated to account for a production-dissipation (input-output) energy balance.
  Two different situations are thoroughly investigated. First, the production-dissipation
  part of the equation is taken as a small perturbation to the KdVE, proportional
  to a smallness parameter ε. It is shown that within times limited by ε−1 (and beyond)
  the KdVE seches interact similarly to the Zabusky and Kruskal''s findings, save
  the “aging” they experience. At longer times the localized solutions adopt the terminal
  shape and phase velocity, and different humps can form bound states. The increase
  of the production-dissipation parameter exaggerates the effects through reducing
  the “practical infinity” for the time scale. For ε ¿ 2 with the rest of parameters
  equal to unity, the solution goes chaotic. These results outline the region where
  the long enough transients can be approximately considered as solitons, albeit imperfect
  ones. The second situation is when the KS part of the equation is predominant. This
  happens either when ε is not small enough or for very long times (t → ∞ or t ⪢ ε−1)
  when strictly permanent shapes are attained which are in fact short waves and the
  dissipation (higher-order derivative) is dominant. It is shown that the solution
  to KSE of homoclinic shape (a hump) does not qualify for a wave-particle/solution
  since it does not persist as a permanent shape after collision and yields to a chaotic
  régime. The heteroclinic shapes (kinks/bores/hydraulic jumps/shocks) do behave as
  particles but the interactions appear to be completely inelastic. After two such
  wave-particles collide they stick to each other and deform to produce a single structure
  of the same kind which carries the total momentum of the system. This kind of (really
  imperfect) solitons may be called “clayons” to emphasize the fact that upon collisions
  they behave as clay balls. Thus the Zabusky and Kruskal''s soliton concept is extended
  in two directions: to “long” transients practically “permanent” and solitonic in
  the time scale ε−1 set by production-dissipation processes and to true permanent
  wave-particles with, however, inelastic behaviour upon collisions.'
