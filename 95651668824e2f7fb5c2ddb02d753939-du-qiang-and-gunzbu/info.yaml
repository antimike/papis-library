abstract: A two-dimensional macroscopic model for superconductivity in thin films
  having variable thickness is derived through an averaging process across the film
  thickness. The resulting model is similar to the well-known Ginzburg-Landau equations
  for homogeneous, isotropic materials, except that a function that describes the
  variations in the thickness of the film now appears in the coefficients of the differential
  equations. Some results about solutions of the variable thickness model are then
  given, including existence of solutions and boundedness of the order parameter.
  It is also shown that the model is consistent in the sense that solutions obtained
  from the new model are an appropriate limit of a sequence of averages of solutions
  of the three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model as the thickness of the film tends
  to zero. An application of the variable thickness thin film model to flux pinning
  is then provided. In particular, the results of numerical calculations are given
  that show that the vortex-like structures that are present in certain superconductors
  are attracted re relatively thin regions in a material sample. Finally, extensions
  of the model to other settings are discussed. Â© 1993.
