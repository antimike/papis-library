abstract: We use the Papapetrou method of multipole expansion to show that a Dirac
  field in the Einstein-Cartan-Kibble-Sciama (ECKS) theory of gravity cannot form
  singular configurations concentrated on one- or two-dimensional surfaces in spacetime.
  Instead, such a field describes a nonsingular particle whose spatial dimension is
  at least on the order of its Cartan radius. In particular, torsion modifies Burinskii's
  model of the Dirac electron as a Kerr-Newman singular ring of the Compton size,
  by replacing the ring with a toroidal structure with the outer radius of the Compton
  size and the inner radius of the Cartan size. We conjecture that torsion produced
  by spin prevents the formation of singularities from matter composed of quarks and
  leptons. We expect that the Cartan radius of an electron, ~10^{-27} m, introduces
  an effective ultraviolet cutoff in quantum field theory for fermions in the ECKS
  spacetime. We also estimate a maximum density of matter to be on the order of the
  corresponding Cartan density, ~10^{51} kg m^{-3}, which gives a lower limit for
  black-hole masses ~10^{16} kg. This limit corresponds to energy ~10^{43} GeV which
  is 39 orders of magnitude larger than the maximum beam energy currently available
  at the LHC. Thus, if torsion exists and the ECKS theory of gravity is correct, the
  LHC cannot produce micro black holes.
