abstract: The relative motion of a classical relativistic spinning test particle is
  studied with respect to a nearby free test particle in the gravitational field of
  a rotating source. The effects of the spin-curvature coupling force are elucidated
  and the implications of the results for the motion of rotating plasma clumps in
  astrophysical jets are discussed.
