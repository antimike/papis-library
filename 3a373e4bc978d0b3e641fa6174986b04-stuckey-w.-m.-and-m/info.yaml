abstract: We propose that quantum physics is the continuous approximation of a more
  fundamental, discrete graph theory (theory X). Accordingly, the Euclidean transition
  amplitude Z provides a partition function for geometries over the graph, which is
  characterized topologically by the difference matrix and source vector of the discrete
  graphical action. The difference matrix and source vector of theory X are related
  via a graphical self-consistency criterion (SCC) based on the boundary of a boundary
  principle on a graph. In this approach, the SCC ensures the source vector is divergence-free
  and resides in the row space of the difference matrix. Accordingly, the difference
  matrix will necessarily have a nontrivial eigenvector with eigenvalue zero, so the
  graphical SCC is the origin of gauge invariance. Factors of infinity associated
  with gauge groups of infinite volume are excluded in our approach, since Z is restricted
  to the row space of the difference matrix and source vector. Using this formalism,
  we obtain the two-source Euclidean transition amplitude over a (1+1)- dimensional
  graph with N vertices fundamental to the scalar Gaussian theory.
