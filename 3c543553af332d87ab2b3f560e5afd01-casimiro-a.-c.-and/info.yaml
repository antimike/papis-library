abstract: The present paper develops a variational theory of discrete fields defined
  on abstract cellular complexes. The discrete formulation is derived solely from
  a variational principle associated to a discrete Lagrangian density on a discrete
  bundle, and developed up to the notion of symmetries and conservation laws for solutions
  of the discrete field equations. The notion of variational integrator for a Cauchy
  problem associated to this variational principle is also studied. The theory is
  then connected with the classical (smooth) formulation of variational field theories,
  describing a functorial method to derive a discrete Lagrangian density from a smooth
  Lagrangian density on a Riemannian fibered manifold, so that all symmetries of the
  Lagrangian turn into symmetries of the corresponding discrete Lagrangian. Elements
  of the discrete and smooth theories are compared and all sources of error between
  them are identified. Finally the whole theory is illustrated with the discretization
  of the classical variational formulation of the kinematics of a Cosserat rod.
