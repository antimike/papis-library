abstract: 'A longstanding issue in attempts to understand the Everett (Many-Worlds)
  approach to quantum mechanics is the origin of the Born rule: why is the probability
  given by the square of the amplitude? Following Vaidman, we note that observers
  are in a position of self-locating uncertainty during the period between the branches
  of the wave function splitting via decoherence and the observer registering the
  outcome of the measurement. In this period it is tempting to regard each branch
  as equiprobable, but we argue that the temptation should be resisted. Applying lessons
  from this analysis, we demonstrate (using methods similar to those of Zurek''s envariance-based
  derivation) that the Born rule is the uniquely rational way of apportioning credence
  in Everettian quantum mechanics. In doing so, we rely on a single key principle:
  changes purely to the environment do not affect the probabilities one ought to assign
  to measurement outcomes in a local subsystem. We arrive at a method for assigning
  probabilities in cases that involve both classical and quantum self-locating uncertainty.
  This method provides unique answers to quantum Sleeping Beauty problems, as well
  as a well-defined procedure for calculating probabilities in quantum cosmological
  multiverses with multiple similar observers.'
