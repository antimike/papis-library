abstract: We present the main ingredients of twistor theory leading up to and including
  the Penrose-Ward transform in a coordinate algebra form which we can then `quantise'
  by means of a functorial cocycle twist. The quantum algebras for the conformal group,
  twistor space CP^3, compactified Minkowski space CMh and the twistor correspondence
  space are obtained along with their canonical quantum differential calculi, both
  in a local form and in a global *-algebra formulation which even in the classical
  commutative case provides a useful alternative to the formulation in terms of projective
  varieties. We outline how the Penrose-Ward transform then quantises. As an example,
  we show that the pull-back of the tautological bundle on CMh pulls back to the basic
  instanton on S^4\subset CMh and that this observation quantises to obtain the Connes-Landi
  instanton on \theta-deformed S^4 as the pull-back of the tautological bundle on
  our \theta-deformed CMh. We likewise quantise the fibration CP^3--> S^4 and use
  it to construct the bundle on \theta-deformed CP^3 that maps over under the transform
  to the \theta-deformed instanton.
