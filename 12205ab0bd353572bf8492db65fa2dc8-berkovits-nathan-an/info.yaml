abstract: Conformal supergravity arises in presently known formulations of twistor-string
  theory either via closed strings or via gauge-singlet open strings. We explore this
  sector of twistor-string theory, relating the relevant string modes to the particles
  and fields of conformal supergravity. We also use the twistor-string theory to compute
  some tree level scattering amplitudes with supergravitons, and compare to expectations
  from conformal supergravity. Since the supergravitons interact with the same coupling
  constant as the Yang-Mills fields, conformal supergravity states will contribute
  to loop amplitudes of Yang-Mills gluons in these theories. Those loop amplitudes
  will therefore not coincide with the loop amplitudes of pure super Yang-Mills theory.
