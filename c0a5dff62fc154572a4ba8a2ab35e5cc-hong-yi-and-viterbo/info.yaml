abstract: In this paper, we provide a solution to the open problem of computing the
  Fourier transform of a binary function defined over $n$-bit vectors taking $m$-bit
  vector values. In particular, we introduce the two-modular Fourier transform (TMFT)
  of a binary function $f:G\rightarrow {\cal R}$, where $G = (\mathbb{F}_2^n,+)$ is
  the group of $n$ bit vectors with bitwise modulo two addition $+$, and ${\cal R}$
  is a finite commutative ring of characteristic $2$. Using the specific group structure
  of $G$ and a sequence of nested subgroups of $G$, we define the fast TMFT and its
  inverse. Since the image ${\cal R}$ of the binary functions is a ring, we can define
  the convolution between two functions $f:G\rightarrow {\cal R}$. We then provide
  the TMFT properties, including the convolution theorem, which can be used to efficiently
  compute convolutions. Finally, we derive the complexity of the fast TMFT and the
  inverse fast TMFT.
