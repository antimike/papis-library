abstract: Penrose conjectured a connection between entropy and Weyl curvature of the
  Universe. This is plausible, as the almost homogeneous and isotropic Universe at
  the onset of structure formation has negligible Weyl curvature, which then grows
  (relative to the Ricci curvature) due to the formation of large-scale structure
  and thus reminds us of the second law of thermodynamics. We study two scalar measures
  to quantify the deviations from a homogeneous and isotropic space-time, the relative
  information entropy and a Weyl tensor invariant, and show their relation to the
  averaging problem. We calculate these two quantities up to second order in standard
  cosmological perturbation theory and find that they are correlated and can be linked
  via the kinematic backreaction of a spatially averaged universe model.
