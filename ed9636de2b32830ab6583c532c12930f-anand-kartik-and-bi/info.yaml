abstract: The quantification of the complexity of networks is, today, a fundamental
  problem in the physics of complex systems. A possible roadmap to solve the problem
  is via extending key concepts of information theory to networks. In this paper we
  propose how to define the Shannon entropy of a network ensemble and how it relates
  to the Gibbs and von Neumann entropies of network ensembles. The quantities we introduce
  here will play a crucial role for the formulation of null models of networks through
  maximum-entropy arguments and will contribute to inference problems emerging in
  the field of complex networks.
