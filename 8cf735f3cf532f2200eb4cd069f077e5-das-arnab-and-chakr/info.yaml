abstract: We review here the recent success in quantum annealing, i.e., optimization
  of the cost or energy functions of complex systems utilizing quantum fluctuations.
  The concept is introduced in successive steps through the studies of mapping of
  such computationally hard problems to the classical spin glass problems. The quantum
  spin glass problems arise with the introduction of quantum fluctuations, and the
  annealing behavior of the systems as these fluctuations are reduced slowly to zero.
  This provides a general framework for realizing analog quantum computation.
