abstract: 'We present a general algorithm constructing a discretization of a classical
  field theory from a Lagrangian. We prove a new discrete Noether theorem relating
  symmetries to conservation laws and an energy conservation theorem not based on
  any symmetry. This gives exact conservation laws for several discrete field theories:
  electrodynamics, gauge theory, Klein-Gordon and Dirac ones. In particular, we construct
  a conserved discrete energy-momentum tensor, approximating the continuum one at
  least for free fields. The theory is stated in topological terms, such as coboundary
  and products of cochains.'
