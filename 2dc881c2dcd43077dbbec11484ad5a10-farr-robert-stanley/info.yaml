abstract: 'Models of discrete space and space-time that exhibit continuum-like behavior
  at large lengths could have profound implications for physics. They may tame the
  infinities that arise from quantizing gravity, and dispense with the machinery of
  the real numbers, which has no direct observational support. Yet despite sophisticated
  attempts at formulating discrete space, researchers have failed to construct even
  the simplest geometries. We investigate graphs as the most elementary discrete models
  of two-dimensional space. We show that if space is discrete, it must be disordered,
  by proving that all planar lattice graphs exhibit the same taxicab metric as square
  grids. We give an explicit recipe for growing disordered discrete space by sampling
  a Boltzmann distribution of graphs at low temperature. We then propose three conditions
  which any discrete model of Euclidean space must meet: have a Hausdorff dimension
  of two, support unique straight lines and obey Pythagoras'' theorem. Our model satisfies
  all three, making it the first discrete model in which continuum-like behavior is
  recovered at large lengths.'
