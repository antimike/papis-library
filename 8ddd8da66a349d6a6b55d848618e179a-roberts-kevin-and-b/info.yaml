abstract: We numerically solve the coupled Landau-Ginzburg-Maxwell equations for a
  model of a spin triplet px+ipy superconductor in which whole or half-quanta of flux
  thread through a hole. We recover the pattern of stable and unstable regions for
  the half-flux quanta observed in a recent experiment. We also examine a scenario
  with bent, Abrikosov integer vortices and find it implausible for the thin, mesoscopic
  ring geometry considered. Â© 2013 American Physical Society.
