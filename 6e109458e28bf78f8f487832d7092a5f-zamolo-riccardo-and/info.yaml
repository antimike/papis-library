abstract: A fictitious domain approach for the solution of second-order linear differential
  problems is proposed; spectral/hp elements have been used for the discretization
  of the domain. The peculiarity of our approach is that the Lagrange multipliers
  are particular distributed functions, instead of classical \$\${\textbackslash}delta
  \$\$Î´Dirac (impulsive) multipliers. In this paper we present the formulation and
  the application of this approach to 1D and 2D Poisson problems and 2D Stokes flow
  (biharmonic equation).
