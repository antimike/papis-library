abstract: Many infrastructure networks have a modular structure and are also interdependent.
  While significant research has explored the resilience of interdependent networks,
  there has been no analysis of the effects of modularity. Here we develop a theoretical
  framework for attacks on interdependent modular networks and support our results
  by simulations. We focus on the case where each network has the same number of communities
  and the dependency links are restricted to be between pairs of communities of different
  networks. This is very realistic for infrastructure across cities. Each city has
  its own infrastructures and different infrastructures are dependent within the city.
  However, each infrastructure is connected within and between cities. For example,
  a power grid will connect many cities as will a communication network, yet a power
  station and communication tower that are interdependent will likely be in the same
  city. It has been shown that single networks are very susceptible to the failure
  of the interconnected nodes (between communities) Shai et al. and that attacks on
  these nodes are more crippling than attacks based on betweenness da Cunha et al.
  In our example of cities these nodes have long range links which are more likely
  to fail. For both treelike and looplike interdependent modular networks we find
  distinct regimes depending on the number of modules, $m$. (i) In the case where
  there are fewer modules with strong intraconnections, the system first separates
  into modules in an abrupt first-order transition and then each module undergoes
  a second percolation transition. (ii) When there are more modules with many interconnections
  between them, the system undergoes a single transition. Overall, we find that modular
  structure can influence the type of transitions observed in interdependent networks
  and should be considered in attempts to make interdependent networks more resilient.
