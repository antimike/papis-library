abstract: We introduce spinors, at a level appropriate for an undergraduate or first
  year graduate course on relativity, astrophysics or particle physics. The treatment
  assumes very little mathematical knowledge (mainly just vector analysis and some
  idea of what a group is). The SU(2)--SO(3) homomorphism is presented in detail.
  Lorentz transformation, chirality, and the spinor Minkowski metric are introduced.
  Applications to electromagnetism, parity violation, and to Dirac spinors are presented.
  A classical form of the Dirac equation is obtained, and the (quantum) prediction
  that $g=2$ for Dirac particles is presented.
