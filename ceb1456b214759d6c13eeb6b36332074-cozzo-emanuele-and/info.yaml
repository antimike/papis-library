abstract: Recent advances in the study of networked systems have highlighted that
  our interconnected world is composed of networks that are coupled to each other
  through different "layers" that each represent one of many possible subsystems or
  types of interactions. Nevertheless, it is traditional to aggregate multilayer networks
  into a single weighted network in order to take advantage of existing tools. This
  is admittedly convenient, but it is also extremely problematic, as important information
  can be lost as a result. It is therefore important to develop multilayer generalizations
  of network concepts. In this paper, we analyze triadic relations and generalize
  the idea of transitivity to multiplex networks. By focusing on triadic relations,
  which yield the simplest type of transitivity, we generalize the concept and computation
  of clustering coefficients to multiplex networks. We show how the layered structure
  of such networks introduces a new degree of freedom that has a fundamental effect
  on transitivity. We compute multiplex clustering coefficients for several real multiplex
  networks and illustrate why one must take great care when generalizing standard
  network concepts to multiplex networks. We also derive analytical expressions for
  our clustering coefficients for ensemble averages of networks in a family of random
  multiplex networks. Our analysis illustrates that social networks have a strong
  tendency to promote redundancy by closing triads at every layer and that they thereby
  have a different type of multiplex transitivity from transportation networks, which
  do not exhibit such a tendency. These insights are invisible if one only studies
  aggregated networks.
