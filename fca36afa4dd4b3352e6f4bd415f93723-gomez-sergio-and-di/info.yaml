abstract: We study the time scales associated to diffusion processes that take place
  on multiplex networks, i.e. on a set of networks linked through interconnected layers.
  To this end, we propose the construction of a supra-Laplacian matrix, which consists
  of a dimensional lifting of the Laplacian matrix of each layer of the multiplex
  network. We use perturbative analysis to reveal analytically the structure of eigenvectors
  and eigenvalues of the complete network in terms of the spectral properties of the
  individual layers. The spectrum of the supra-Laplacian allows us to understand the
  physics of diffusion-like processes on top of multiplex networks.
