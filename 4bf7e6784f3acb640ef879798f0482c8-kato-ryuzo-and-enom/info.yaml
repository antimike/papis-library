abstract: Computer simulations, based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation
  of the magnetization process of type-II superconductors in a magnetic field are
  presented. It is shown how the magnetic flux penetrates into and goes out of the
  superconductor through the surface boundary, i.e., the superconductor-insulator
  interface. By examining the hysteresis curve of the magnetization, the surface pinning
  field is derived. The flux distribution and its time development in the superconductor
  are calculated when the magnetic field is increased or decreased. We also study
  the surface and edge states of the type-II superconductor above the upper critical
  field. Â© 1993 The American Physical Society.
