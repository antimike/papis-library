abstract: The geometro-stochastic method of quantization provides a framework for
  quantum general relativity, in which the principal frame bundles of local Lorentz
  frames that underlie the fibre-theoretical approach to classical general relativity
  are replaced by Poincar\'e-covariant quantum frame bundles. In the semiclassical
  regime for quantum field theory in curved spacetime, where the gravitational field
  is not quantized, the elements of these local quantum frames are generalized coherent
  states, which emerge naturally from phase space representations of the Poincar\'e
  group. Due to their informational completeness, these quantum frames are capable
  of taking over the role played by complete sets of observables in conventional quantum
  theory. The propagation of quantum-geometric fields proceeds by path integral methods,
  based on parallel transport along broken paths consisting of arcs of geodesics of
  the Levi-Civita connection. The formulation of quantum gravity within this framework
  necessitates the transition to quantum superframe bundles and a quantum gravitational
  supergroup capable of incorporating diffeomorphism invariance into the framework.
  This results in a geometric version of quantum gravity which shares some conceptual
  features with covariant as well as with canonical gravity, but which avoids the
  foundational and the mathematical difficulties encountered by these two approaches.
