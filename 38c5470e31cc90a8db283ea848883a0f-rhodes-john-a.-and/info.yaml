abstract: We develop a relativistic velocity space called \emph{rapidity space} from
  the single assumption of Lorentz invariance, and use it to visualize and calculate
  effects resulting from the successive application of non-colinear Lorentz boosts.
  In particular, we show how rapidity space provides a geometric approach to Wigner
  rotation and Thomas precession in the same way that spacetime provides a geometrical
  approach to kinematic effects in special relativity.
