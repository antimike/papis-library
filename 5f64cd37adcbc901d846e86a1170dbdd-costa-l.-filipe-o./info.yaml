abstract: The motion of spinning test particles in general relativity is described
  by Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, which are undetermined up to a spin supplementary
  condition, the latter being today still an open question. The Mathisson-Pirani (MP)
  condition is known to lead to rather mysterious helical motions which have been
  deemed unphysical, and for this reason discarded. We show that these assessments
  are unfounded and originate from a subtle (but crucial) misconception. We discuss
  the kinematical explanation of the helical motions, and dynamically interpret them
  through the concept of hidden momentum, which has an electromagnetic analogue. We
  also show that, contrary to previous claims, the frequency of the helical motions
  coincides exactly with the zitterbewegung frequency of the Dirac equation for the
  electron.
