abstract: In the past years, network theory has successfully characterized the interaction
  among the constituents of a variety of complex systems, ranging from biological
  to technological, and social systems. However, up until recently, attention was
  almost exclusively given to networks in which all components were treated on equivalent
  footing, while neglecting all the extra information about the temporal- or context-related
  properties of the interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage
  of the enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their
  interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly considered
  the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a comprehensive
  review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs made of diverse relationships
  (layers) between its constituents, and cover several relevant issues, from a full
  redefinition of the basic structural measures, to understanding how the multilayer
  nature of the network affects processes and dynamics.
