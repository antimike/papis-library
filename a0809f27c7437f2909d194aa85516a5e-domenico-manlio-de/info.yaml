abstract: 'Unveiling the community structure of networks is a powerful methodology
  to comprehend interconnected systems across the social and natural sciences. To
  identify different types of functional modules in interaction data aggregated in
  a single network layer, researchers have developed many powerful methods. For example,
  flow-based methods have proven useful for identifying modular dynamics in weighted
  and directed networks that capture constraints on flow in the systems they represent.
  However, many networked systems consist of agents or components that exhibit multiple
  layers of interactions. Inevitably, representing this intricate network of networks
  as a single aggregated network leads to information loss and may obscure the actual
  organization. Here we propose a method based on compression of network flows that
  can identify modular flows in non-aggregated multilayer networks. Our numerical
  experiments on synthetic networks show that the method can accurately identify modules
  that cannot be identified in aggregated networks or by analyzing the layers separately.
  We capitalize on our findings and reveal the community structure of two multilayer
  collaboration networks: scientists affiliated to the Pierre Auger Observatory and
  scientists publishing works on networks on the arXiv. Compared to conventional aggregated
  methods, the multilayer method reveals smaller modules with more overlap that better
  capture the actual organization.'
