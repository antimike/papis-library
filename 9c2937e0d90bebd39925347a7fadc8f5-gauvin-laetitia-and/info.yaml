abstract: The increasing availability of temporal network data is calling for more
  research on extracting and characterizing mesoscopic structures in temporal networks
  and on relating such structure to specific functions or properties of the system.
  An outstanding challenge is the extension of the results achieved for static networks
  to time-varying networks, where the topological structure of the system and the
  temporal activity patterns of its components are intertwined. Here we investigate
  the use of a latent factor decomposition technique, non-negative tensor factorization,
  to extract the community-activity structure of temporal networks. The method is
  intrinsically temporal and allows to simultaneously identify communities and to
  track their activity over time. We represent the time-varying adjacency matrix of
  a temporal network as a three-way tensor and approximate this tensor as a sum of
  terms that can be interpreted as communities of nodes with an associated activity
  time series. We summarize known computational techniques for tensor decomposition
  and discuss some quality metrics that can be used to tune the complexity of the
  factorized representation. We subsequently apply tensor factorization to a temporal
  network for which a ground truth is available for both the community structure and
  the temporal activity patterns. The data we use describe the social interactions
  of students in a school, the associations between students and school classes, and
  the spatio-temporal trajectories of students over time. We show that non-negative
  tensor factorization is capable of recovering the class structure with high accuracy.
  In particular, the extracted tensor components can be validated either as known
  school classes, or in terms of correlated activity patterns, i.e., of spatial and
  temporal coincidences that are determined by the known school activity schedule.
