abstract: Dempster’s rule is traditionally interpreted as an operator for fusing belief
  functions. While there are different types of belief fusion, there has been considerable
  confusion regarding the exact type of operation that Dempster’s rule performs. Many
  alternative operators for belief fusion have been proposed, where some are based
  on the same fundamental principle as Dempster’s rule, and others have a totally
  different basis, such as the cumulative and averaging fusion operators. In this
  article, we analyze Dempster’s rule from a statistical and frequentist perspective
  and compare it with cumulative and averaging belief fusion. We prove, and illustrate
  by examples on colored balls, that Dempster’s rule in fact represents a method for
  serial combination of stochastic constraints. Consequently, Dempster’s rule is not
  a method for cumulative fusion of belief functions under the assumption that subjective
  beliefs are an extension of frequentist beliefs. Having identified the true nature
  of Dempster’s rule, appropriate applications of Dempster’s rule of combination are
  described such as the multiplication of orthogonal belief functions, and the combination
  of preferences dictated by different parties.
