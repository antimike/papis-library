abstract: It is shown that the equations of motion of a test point particle with spin
  in a given gravitational field, so called Mathisson - Papapetrou equations, can
  be derived from Euler - Lagrange equations of the relativistic pseudomechanics --
  relativistic mechanics, which side by side uses the conventional (commuting) and
  Grassmannian (anticommuting) variables. In this approach the known difficulties
  of the Mathisson - Papapetrou equations, namely, the problem of the choice of supplementary
  conditions and the problem of higher derivatives are not appear.
