abstract: Our assumption that spacetime is a continuum leads to many challenges in
  mathematical physics. Singularities, divergent integrals and the like threaten many
  of our favorite theories, from Newtonian gravity to classical electrodynamics, quantum
  electrodynamics and the Standard Model. In general relativity, singularities are
  intimately connected to some of the theory's most dramatic successful predictions.
  We survey these problems and the large amount of work that has gone into dealing
  with them.
