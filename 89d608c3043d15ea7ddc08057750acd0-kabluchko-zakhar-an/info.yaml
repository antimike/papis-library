abstract: Introduced is the notion of minimality for spectral representations of sum-
  and max-infinitely divisible processes and it is shown that the minimal spectral
  representation on a Borel space exists and is unique. This fact is used to show
  that a stationary, stochastically continuous, sum- or max-i.d. random process on
  $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be generated by a measure-preserving flow on a $\sigma$-finite
  Borel measure space and that this flow is unique. This development makes it possible
  to extend the classification program of Rosi\'{n}ski (Ann. Probab. 23 (1995) 1163-1187)
  with a unified treatment of both sum- and max-infinitely divisible processes. As
  a particular case, a characterization of stationary, stochastically continuous,
  union-infinitely divisible random measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is obtained.
  Introduced and classified are several new max-i.d. random field models including
  fields of Penrose type and fields associated to Poisson line processes.
