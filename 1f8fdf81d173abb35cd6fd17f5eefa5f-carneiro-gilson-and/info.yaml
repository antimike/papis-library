abstract: General expressions are given for the magnetic field and energy of arbitrary
  arrangements of straight and curved vortices in an anisotropic superconductor film
  of finite thickness within anisotropic London theory. As examples we consider the
  magnetic field and interaction of straight perpendicular vortex lines in films of
  finite thickness. Â© 2000 The American Physical Society.
