abstract: We propose a dual formulation for the S Matrix of N = 4 SYM. The dual provides
  a basis for the "leading singularities" of scattering amplitudes to all orders in
  perturbation theory, which are sharply defined, IR safe data that uniquely determine
  the full amplitudes at tree level and 1-loop, and are conjectured to do so at all
  loop orders. The scattering amplitude for n particles in the sector with k negative
  helicity gluons is associated with a simple integral over the space of k planes
  in n dimensions, with the action of parity and cyclic symmetries manifest. The residues
  of the integrand compute a basis for the leading singularities. A given leading
  singularity is associated with a particular choice of integration contour, which
  we explicitly identify at tree level and 1-loop for all NMHV amplitudes as well
  as the 8 particle NNMHV amplitude. We also identify a number of 2-loop leading singularities
  for up to 8 particles. There are a large number of relations among residues which
  follow from the multi-variable generalization of Cauchy's theorem known as the "global
  residue theorem". These relations imply highly non-trivial identities guaranteeing
  the equivalence of many different representations of the same amplitude. They also
  enforce the cancellation of non-local poles as well as consistent infrared structure
  at loop level. Our conjecture connects the physics of scattering amplitudes to a
  particular subvariety in a Grassmannian; space-time locality is reflected in the
  topological properties of this space.
