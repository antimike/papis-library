abstract: A binary vector of length $N$ has elements that are either 0 or 1. We investigate
  the question of whether and how a binary vector of known length can be reconstructed
  from a limited set of its discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients. A priori
  information that the vector is binary provides a powerful constraint. We prove that
  a binary vector is uniquely defined by its two complex DFT coefficients (zeroth,
  which gives the popcount, and first) if $N$ is prime. If $N$ has two prime factors,
  additional DFT coefficients must be included in the data set to guarantee uniqueness,
  and we find the number of required coefficients theoretically. One may need to know
  even more DFT coefficients to guarantee stability of inversion. However, our results
  indicate that stable inversion can be obtained when the number of known coefficients
  is about $1/3$ of the total. This entails the effect of super-resolution (the resolution
  limit is improved by the factor of $\sim 3$).
