abstract: Network representations are useful for describing the structure of a large
  variety of complex systems. Although most studies of real-world networks suppose
  that nodes are connected by only a single type of edge, most natural and engineered
  systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity. This new paradigm
  has attracted a great deal of attention and one fundamental challenge is to characterize
  multilayer networks both structurally and dynamically. One way to address this question
  is to study the spectral properties of such networks. Here, we apply the framework
  of graph quotients, which occurs naturally in this context, and the associated eigenvalue
  interlacing results, to the adjacency and Laplacian matrices of undirected multilayer
  networks. Specifically, we describe relationships between the eigenvalue spectra
  of multilayer networks and their two most natural quotients, the network of layers
  and the aggregate network, and show the dynamical implications of working with either
  of the two simplified representations. Our work thus contributes in particular to
  the study of dynamical processes whose critical properties are determined by the
  spectral properties of the underlying network.
