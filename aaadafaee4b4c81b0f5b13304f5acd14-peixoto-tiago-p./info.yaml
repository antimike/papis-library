abstract: Many network systems are composed of interdependent but distinct types of
  interactions, which cannot be fully understood in isolation. These different types
  of interactions are often represented as layers, attributes on the edges or as a
  time-dependence of the network structure. Although they are crucial for a more comprehensive
  scientific understanding, these representations offer substantial challenges. Namely,
  it is an open problem how to precisely characterize the large or mesoscale structure
  of network systems in relation to these additional aspects. Furthermore, the direct
  incorporation of these features invariably increases the effective dimension of
  the network description, and hence aggravates the problem of overfitting, i.e. the
  use of overly-complex characterizations that mistake purely random fluctuations
  for actual structure. In this work, we propose a robust and principled method to
  tackle these problems, by constructing generative models of modular network structure,
  incorporating layered, attributed and time-varying properties, as well as a nonparametric
  Bayesian methodology to infer the parameters from data and select the most appropriate
  model according to statistical evidence. We show that the method is capable of revealing
  hidden structure in layered, edge-valued and time-varying networks, and that the
  most appropriate level of granularity with respect to the additional dimensions
  can be reliably identified. We illustrate our approach on a variety of empirical
  systems, including a social network of physicians, the voting correlations of deputies
  in the Brazilian national congress, the global airport network, and a proximity
  network of high-school students.
