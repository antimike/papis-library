abstract: We present a worldsheet theory that describes maps into a curved target
  space equipped with a B-field and dilaton. The conditions for the theory to be consistent
  at the quantum level can be computed exactly, and are that the target space fields
  obey the nonlinear d=10 supergravity equations of motion, with no higher curvature
  terms. The path integral is constrained to obey a generalization of the scattering
  equations to curved space. Remarkably, the supergravity field equations emerge as
  quantum corrections to these curved space scattering equations.
