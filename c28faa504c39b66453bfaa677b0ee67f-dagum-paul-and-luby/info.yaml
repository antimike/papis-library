abstract: It is known that exact computation of conditional probabilities in belief
  networks is NP-hard. Many investigators in the AI community have tacitly assumed
  that algorithms for performing approximate inference with belief networks are of
  polynomial complexity. Indeed, special cases of approximate inference can be performed
  in time polynomial in the input size. However, we have discovered that the general
  problem of approximating conditional probabilities with belief networks, like exact
  inference, resides in the NP-hard complexity class. We develop a complexity analysis
  to elucidate the difficulty of approximate probabilistic inference. More specifically,
  we show that the existence of a polynomial-time relative approximation algorithm
  for major classes of problem instances implies that NP âŠ† P. We present our proof
  and explore the implications of the result.
