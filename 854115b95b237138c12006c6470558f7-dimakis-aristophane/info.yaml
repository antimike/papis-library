abstract: In a series of publications we developed "differential geometry" on discrete
  sets based on concepts of noncommutative geometry. In particular, it turned out
  that first order differential calculi (over the algebra of functions) on a discrete
  set are in bijective correspondence with digraph structures where the vertices are
  given by the elements of the set. A particular class of digraphs are Cayley graphs,
  also known as group lattices. They are determined by a discrete group G and a finite
  subset S. There is a distinguished subclass of "bicovariant" Cayley graphs with
  the property that ad(S)S is contained in S.   We explore the properties of differential
  calculi which arise from Cayley graphs via the above correspondence. The first order
  calculi extend to higher orders and then allow to introduce further differential
  geometric structures.   Furthermore, we explore the properties of "discrete" vector
  fields which describe deterministic flows on group lattices. A Lie derivative with
  respect to a discrete vector field and an inner product with forms is defined. The
  Lie-Cartan identity then holds on all forms for a certain subclass of discrete vector
  fields.   We develop elements of gauge theory and construct an analogue of the lattice
  gauge theory (Yang-Mills) action on an arbitrary group lattice. Also linear connections
  are considered and a simple geometric interpretation of the torsion is established.   By
  taking a quotient with respect to some subgroup of the discrete group, generalized
  differential calculi associated with so-called Schreier diagrams are obtained.
