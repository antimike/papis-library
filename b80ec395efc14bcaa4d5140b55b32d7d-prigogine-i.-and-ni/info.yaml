abstract: Complex behaviour made its appearance in the physical sciences in a modest,
  low-key fashion. For a long time, in the mind of most physicists and chemists, complexity
  was associated with biological order and its multiple manifestations, for example
  at the level of evolution, embryogenesis and population dynamics. Physical sciences
  on the other side were aiming at a description of nature in terms of laws of universal
  validity. And to this end they were utilising simple models to which, hopefully,
  the description of more complicated systems could be reduced. This feeling has been
  repreatedly expressed by some of the greatest scientists of our century. Thus, for
  Einstein “the physicist must content himself with describing the most simple events
  which can be brought within the domain of our experience; all events of a more complex
  order are beyond the power of the human intellect to reconstruct with the subtle
  accuracy and logical perfection which the theoretical physicist demands …. The general
  laws on which the structure of theoretical physics is based claim to be valid for
  any natural phenomenon whatsoever.
