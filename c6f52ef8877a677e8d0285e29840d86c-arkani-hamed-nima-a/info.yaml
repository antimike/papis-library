abstract: The simplicity and hidden symmetries of (Super) Yang-Mills and (Super)Gravity
  scattering amplitudes suggest the existence of a "weak-weak" dual formulation in
  which these structures are made manifest at the expense of manifest locality. We
  suggest that this dual description lives in (2,2) signature and is naturally formulated
  in twistor space. We recast the BCFW recursion relations in an on-shell form that
  begs to be transformed into twistor space. Our twistor transformation is inspired
  by Witten's, but differs in treating twistor and dual twistor variables more equally.
  In these variables the three and four-point amplitudes are amazingly simple; the
  BCFW relations are represented by diagrammatic rules that precisely define the "twistor
  diagrams" of Andrew Hodges. The "Hodges diagrams" for Yang-Mills theory are disks
  and not trees; they reveal striking connections between amplitudes and suggest a
  new form for them in momentum space. We also obtain a twistorial formulation of
  gravity. All tree amplitudes can be combined into an "S-Matrix" functional which
  is the natural holographic observable in asymptotically flat space; the BCFW formula
  turns into a quadratic equation for this "S-Matrix", providing a holographic description
  of N=4 SYM and N=8 Supergravity at tree level. We explore loop amplitudes in (2,2)
  signature and twistor space, beginning with a discussion of IR behavior. We find
  that the natural pole prescription renders the amplitudes well-defined and free
  of IR divergences. Loop amplitudes vanish for generic momenta, and in twistor space
  are even simpler than their tree-level counterparts! This further supports the idea
  that there exists a sharply defined object corresponding to the S-Matrix in (2,2)
  signature, computed by a dual theory naturally living in twistor space.
