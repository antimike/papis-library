abstract: Following a proposal of Vaidman, Sebens and Carroll have argued that in
  Everettian (i.e. purely unitary) quantum theory, observers are uncertain, before
  they complete their observation, about which Everettian branch they are on. They
  argue further that this solves the problem of making sense of probabilities within
  Everettian quantum theory, even though the theory itself is deterministic. We note
  some problems with these arguments.
