abstract: The behavior of a hollow superconducting cylinder of arbitrary dimensions
  in an external magnetic field is investigated in detail within the Ginzburg-Landau
  macroscopic theory. The thermodynamic potential of the system is presented in a
  compact form, which enables us to give a simpler description of the transitions
  of the system between the quantized levels in a magnetic field than in previous
  work on this subject. The general theory is illustrated by a number of cases, which
  show the dependence of the order parameter, the total flux in a cavity, and the
  magnetic moment of the cylinder on the magnitude of the external field and on temperature.
  The phase transition curves and the hysteresis boundaries are found. The tricritical
  points, where the difference between first- and second-order phase transitions vanishes,
  are established. The oscillations in a magnetic field of the specific heat of the
  cyclinder are investigated. The formulas are presented for the case of a thin-walled
  cylinder and are valid for arbitrary values of the order parameter ψ, inner and
  outer radii of the cylinder, external field, and temperature. The results are discussed
  in connection with experiment and other papers on this subject. © 1983 Plenum Publishing
