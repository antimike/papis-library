abstract: We show that, in quaternionic geometry, the Ward transform is a manifestation
  of the functoriality of the basic correspondence between the $\rho$-quaternionic
  manifolds and their twistor spaces. We apply this fact, together with the Penrose
  transform, to obtain existence results for hypercomplex manifolds and for harmonic
  morphisms from hyper-Kaehler manifolds.
