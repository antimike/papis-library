abstract: We show that string theories admit chiral infinite tension analogues in
  which only the massless parts of the spectrum survive. Geometrically they describe
  holomorphic maps to spaces of complex null geodesics, known as ambitwistor spaces.
  They have the standard critical space--time dimensions of string theory (26 in the
  bosonic case and 10 for the superstring). Quantization leads to the formulae for
  tree--level scattering amplitudes of massless particles found recently by Cachazo,
  He and Yuan. These representations localize the vertex operators to solutions of
  the same equations found by Gross and Mende to govern the behaviour of strings in
  the limit of high energy, fixed angle scattering. Here, localization to the scattering
  equations emerges naturally as a consequence of working on ambitwistor space. The
  worldsheet theory suggests a way to extend these amplitudes to spinor fields and
  to loop level. We argue that this family of string theories is a natural extension
  of the existing twistor string theories.
