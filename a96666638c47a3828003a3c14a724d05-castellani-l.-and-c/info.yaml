abstract: We study de Rham cohomology for various differential calculi on finite groups
  G up to order 8. These include the permutation group S_3, the dihedral group D_4
  and the quaternion group Q. Poincare' duality holds in every case, and under some
  assumptions (essentially the existence of a top form) we find that it must hold
  in general.   A short review of the bicovariant (noncommutative) differential calculus
  on finite G is given for selfconsistency. Exterior derivative, exterior product,
  metric, Hodge dual, connections, torsion, curvature, and biinvariant integration
  can be defined algebraically. A projector decomposition of the braiding operator
  is found, and used in constructing the projector on the space of 2-forms. By means
  of the braiding operator and the metric a knot invariant is defined for any finite
  group.
