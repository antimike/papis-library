abstract: A theorem of J. Kruskal from 1977, motivated by a latent-class statistical
  model, established that under certain explicit conditions the expression of a 3-dimensional
  tensor as the sum of rank-1 tensors is essentially unique. We give a new proof of
  this fundamental result, which is substantially shorter than both the original one
  and recent versions along the original lines.
