abstract: How can we localize the source of diffusion in a complex network? Due to
  the tremendous size of many real networks--such as the Internet or the human social
  graph--it is usually infeasible to observe the state of all nodes in a network.
  We show that it is fundamentally possible to estimate the location of the source
  from measurements collected by sparsely-placed observers. We present a strategy
  that is optimal for arbitrary trees, achieving maximum probability of correct localization.
  We describe efficient implementations with complexity O(N^{\alpha}), where \alpha=1
  for arbitrary trees, and \alpha=3 for arbitrary graphs. In the context of several
  case studies, we determine how localization accuracy is affected by various system
  parameters, including the structure of the network, the density of observers, and
  the number of observed cascades.
