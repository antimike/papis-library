abstract: The existence of a non-algorithmic side of the mind, conjectured by Penrose
  on the basis of G\"odel's first incompleteness theorem, is investigated here in
  terms of a quantum metalanguage. We suggest that, besides human ordinary thought,
  which can be formalized in a computable, logical language, there is another important
  kind of human thought, which is Turing-non-computable. This is methatought, the
  process of thinking about ordinary thought. Metathought can be formalized as a metalanguage,
  which speaks about and controls the logical language of ordinary thought. Ordinary
  thought has two computational modes, the quantum mode and the classical mode, the
  latter deriving from decoherence of the former. In order to control the logical
  language of the quantum mode, one needs to introduce a quantum metalanguage, which
  in turn requires a quantum version of Tarski Convention T.
