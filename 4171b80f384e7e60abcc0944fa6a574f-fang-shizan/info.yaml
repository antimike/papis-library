abstract: 'What is the suitable Laplace operator on vector fields for the Navier-Stokes
  equation on a Riemannian manifold? In this note, by considering Nash embedding,
  we will try to elucidate different aspects of different Laplace operators such as
  de Rham-Hodge Laplacian as well as Ebin-Marsden''s Laplacian. A probabilistic representation
  formula for Navier-Stokes equations on a general compact Riemannian manifold is
  obtained when de Rham-Hodge Laplacian is involved. MSC 2010: 35Q30, 58J65'
