abstract: 'We present statistical analyses of the large-scale structure of three types
  of semantic networks: word associations, WordNet, and Roget''s thesaurus. We show
  that they have a small-world structure, characterized by sparse connectivity, short
  average path-lengths between words, and strong local clustering. In addition, the
  distributions of the number of connections follow power laws that indicate a scale-free
  pattern of connectivity, with most nodes having relatively few connections joined
  together through a small number of hubs with many connections. These regularities
  have also been found in certain other complex natural networks, such as the world
  wide web, but they are not consistent with many conventional models of semantic
  organization, based on inheritance hierarchies, arbitrarily structured networks,
  or high-dimensional vector spaces. We propose that these structures reflect the
  mechanisms by which semantic networks grow. We describe a simple model for semantic
  growth, in which each new word or concept is connected to an existing network by
  differentiating the connectivity pattern of an existing node. This model generates
  appropriate small-world statistics and power-law connectivity distributions, and
  also suggests one possible mechanistic basis for the effects of learning history
  variables (age-of-acquisition, usage frequency) on behavioral performance in semantic
  processing tasks.'
