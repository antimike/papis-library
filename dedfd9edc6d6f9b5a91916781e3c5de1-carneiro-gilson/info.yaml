abstract: Interactions between vortices in planar superconducting films and a point
  magnetic dipole placed outside the film, and the creation of vortices by the dipole,
  are studied in the London limit. The exact solution of London equations for films
  of arbitrary thickness with a generic distribution of vortex lines, curved or straight,
  is obtained by generalizing the results reported by the present author and Brandt
  [Phys. Rev. B 61, 6370 (2000)] for films without the dipole. From this solution
  the total energy of the vortex-dipole system is obtained as a functional of the
  vortex distribution. The vortex configurations created by the dipole minimize the
  energy functional. It is shown that the vortex-dipole interaction energy is given
  by -mÂ·bvac, where m is the dipole strength and bvac is the magnetic field of the
  vortices at the dipole position, and that it can also be written in terms of a magnetic
  pinning potential acting on the vortices. The properties of this potential are studied
  in detail. Vortex configurations created by the dipole on films of thickness comparable
  to the penetration depth are obtained by discretizing the exact London theory results
  on a cubic lattice and minimizing the energy functional using a numerical algorithm
  based on simulated annealing. These configurations are found to consist, in general,
  of curved vortex lines and vortex loops.
