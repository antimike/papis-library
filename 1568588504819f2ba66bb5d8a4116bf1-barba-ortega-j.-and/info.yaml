abstract: We theoretically investigate the local magnetic field, order parameter and
  supercurrent profiles of a parallelepiped mesoscopic superconductor submersed in
  an applied magnetic field; this same geometry with a pillar on its top surface is
  also considered. Our investigation was carried out by solving the three-dimensional
  time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations. We obtain the magnetization curve
  as a function of the external applied magnetic field for several sample sizes. We
  have determined an analytical dependence of the thermodynamic fields and the magnetization
  as functions of the lateral dimension of the superconductor. Finally, a systematic
  comparative study of the two- and three-dimensional approaches of the Ginzburg-Landau
  model is carried out.
