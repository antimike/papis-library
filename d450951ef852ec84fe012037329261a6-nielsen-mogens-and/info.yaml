abstract: The application scenarios envisioned for ‘global ubiquitous computing’ have
  unique requirements that are often incompatible with traditional security paradigms.
  One alternative currently being investigated is to support security decision-making
  by explicit representation of principals' trusting relationships, i.e., via systems
  for computational trust. We focus here on systems where trust in a computational
  entity is interpreted as the expectation of certain future behaviour based on behavioural
  patterns of the past, and concern ourselves with the foundations of such probabilistic
  systems. In particular, we aim at establishing formal probabilistic models for computational
  trust and their fundamental properties. In the paper we define a mathematical measure
  for quantitatively comparing the effectiveness of probabilistic computational trust
  systems in various environments. Using it, we compare some of the systems from the
  computational trust literature; the comparison is derived formally, rather than
  obtained via experimental simulation as traditionally done. With this foundation
  in place, we formalise a general notion of information about past behaviour, based
  on event structures. This yields a flexible trust model where the probability of
  complex protocol outcomes can be assessed.
