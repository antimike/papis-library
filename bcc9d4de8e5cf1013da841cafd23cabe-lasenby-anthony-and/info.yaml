abstract: A new gauge theory of gravity is presented. The theory is constructed in
  a flat background spacetime and employs gauge fields to ensure that all relations
  between physical quantities are independent of the positions and orientations of
  the matter fields. In this manner all properties of the background spacetime are
  removed from physics, and what remains are a set of `intrinsic' relations between
  physical fields. The properties of the gravitational gauge fields are derived from
  both classical and quantum viewpoints. Field equations are then derived from an
  action principle, and consistency with the minimal coupling procedure selects an
  action that is unique up to the possible inclusion of a cosmological constant. This
  in turn singles out a unique form of spin-torsion interaction. A new method for
  solving the field equations is outlined and applied to the case of a time-dependent,
  spherically-symmetric perfect fluid. A gauge is found which reduces the physics
  to a set of essentially Newtonian equations. These equations are then applied to
  the study of cosmology, and to the formation and properties of black holes. The
  existence of global solutions enables one to discuss the properties of field lines
  inside the horizon due to a point charge held outside it. The Dirac equation is
  studied in a black hole background and provides a quick derivation of the Hawking
  temperature.
