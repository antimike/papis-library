abstract: We show how the high order finite element spaces of differential forms due
  to Raviart-Thomas-N\'edelec-Hiptmair fit into the framework of finite element systems,
  in an elaboration of the finite element exterior calculus of Arnold-Falk-Winther.
  Based on observations by Bossavit, we provide new low order degrees of freedom.
  As an alternative to existing choices of bases, we provide canonical resolutions
  in terms of scalar polynomials and Whitney forms.
