abstract: The Meissner state with finite London penetration depth is analyzed for
  platelet samples of rectangular cross section in a perpendicular magnetic field.
  The exact two-dimensional numerical solution of the London equation is extended
  analytically to the realistic three dimensional case. Data obtained on Nb cylinders
  and foils, as well as single crystals of Y-Ba-Cu-O and Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O, are in a good
  agreement with the model. The results are particularly relevant for magnetic susceptibility,
  rf, and microwave resonator measurements of the magnetic penetration depth in high-(Formula
  presented) superconductors. Â© 2000 The American Physical Society.
