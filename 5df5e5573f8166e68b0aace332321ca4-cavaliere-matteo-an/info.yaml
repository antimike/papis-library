abstract: Social, biological and economic networks grow and decline with occasional
  fragmentation and re-formation, often explained in terms of external perturbations.
  We show that these phenomena can be a direct consequence of simple imitation and
  internal conflicts between 'cooperators' and 'defectors'. We employ a game-theoretic
  model of dynamic network formation where successful individuals are more likely
  to be imitated by newcomers who adopt their strategies and copy their social network.
  We find that, despite using the same mechanism, cooperators promote well-connected
  highly prosperous networks and defectors cause the network to fragment and lose
  its prosperity; defectors are unable to maintain the highly connected networks they
  invade. Once the network is fragmented it can be reconstructed by a new invasion
  of cooperators, leading to the cycle of formation and fragmentation seen, for example,
  in bacterial communities and socio-economic networks. In this endless struggle between
  cooperators and defectors we observe that cooperation leads to prosperity, but prosperity
  is associated with instability. Cooperation is prosperous when the network has frequent
  formation and fragmentation.
