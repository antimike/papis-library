abstract: A three-dimensional (3D) finite-element formulation for calculating Meissner
  currents in multiply connected superconductors is presented. The fluxoid quantization
  condition is ensured as simply as possible. The problem is formulated so that we
  have to solve two systems of equations by the use of a conjugate gradient algorithm
  without preconditioning. Meissner currents and magnetic-flux density are numerically
  evaluated in a superconducting tube and around a vortex. These results are compared
  with analytical solutions.
