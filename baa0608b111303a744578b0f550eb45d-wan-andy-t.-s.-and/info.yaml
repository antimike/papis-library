abstract: We present the multiplier method of constructing conservative finite difference
  schemes for ordinary and partial differential equations. Given a system of differential
  equations possessing conservation laws, our approach is based on discretizing conservation
  law multipliers and their associated density and flux functions. We show that the
  proposed discretization is consistent for any order of accuracy when the discrete
  multiplier has a multiplicative inverse. Moreover, we show that by construction,
  discrete densities can be exactly conserved. In particular, the multiplier method
  does not require the system to possess a Hamiltonian or variational structure. Examples,
  including dissipative problems, are given to illustrate the method. In the case
  when the inverse of the discrete multiplier becomes singular, consistency of the
  method is also established for scalar ODEs provided the discrete multiplier and
  density are zero-compatible.
