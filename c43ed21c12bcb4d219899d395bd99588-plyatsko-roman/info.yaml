abstract: First, we stress that for correct description of highly relativistic fermions
  in a gravitational field it is necessary to have an equation which in the limiting
  transition to the classical (non-quantum) case corresponds to the exact Mathisson-Papapetrou
  equations. According to these equations the spin in general relativity is Fermi-transported,
  and the parallel transport of spin is realized only in some approximation. The traditional
  general-relativistic Dirac equation (1929) is based on the parallel transported
  spinors and does not ensure the correspondent transition. Second, because in the
  range of very high velocity (close to the speed of light) of a spinning particle
  relative to the Schwarzschild or Kerr sources the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations
  have the solutions which reveal that the spin-gravity interaction acts as a strong
  antigravity force, we suppose that this fact can be useful for explanation some
  astrophysical phenomena. Some association with the OPERA results is possible.
