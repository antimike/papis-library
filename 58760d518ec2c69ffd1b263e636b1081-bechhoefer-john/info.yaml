abstract: The implications of causality, as captured by the Kramers-Kronig relations
  between the real and imaginary parts of a linear response function, are familiar
  parts of the physics curriculum. In 1937, Bode derived a similar relation between
  the magnitude (response gain) and phase. Although the Kramers-Kronig relations are
  an equality, Bode's relation is effectively an inequality. This perhaps-surprising
  difference is explained using elementary examples and ultimately traces back to
  delays in the flow of information within the system formed by the physical object
  and measurement apparatus.
