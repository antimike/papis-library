abstract: We present a twistor description for null two-surfaces (null strings) in
  4D Minkowski space-time. The Lagrangian density for a variational principle is taken
  as a surface-forming null bivector. The proposed formulation is reparametrization
  invariant and free of any algebraic and differential constraints. The spinor formalism
  of Cartan-Penrose allows us to derive a non-linear evolution equation for the world-sheet
  coordinate. An example of null two-surface given by the two-dimensional self-intersection
  (caustic) of a null hypersurface is studied.
