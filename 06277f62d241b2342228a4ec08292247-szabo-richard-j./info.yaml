abstract: A pedagogical and self-contained introduction to noncommutative quantum
  field theory is presented, with emphasis on those properties that are intimately
  tied to string theory and gravity. Topics covered include the Weyl-Wigner correspondence,
  noncommutative Feynman diagrams, UV/IR mixing, noncommutative Yang-Mills theory
  on infinite space and on the torus, Morita equivalences of noncommutative gauge
  theories, twisted reduced models, and an in-depth study of the gauge group of noncommutative
  Yang-Mills theory. Some of the more mathematical ideas and techniques of noncommutative
  geometry are also briefly explained.
