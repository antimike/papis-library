abstract: Unlike the Lorentz transformation which replaces the Galilean transformation
  among inertial frames at high relative velocities, there seems to be no such a consensus
  in the case of coordinate transformation between inertial frames and uniformly rotating
  ones. There have been some attempts to generalize the Galilean rotational transformation
  to high rotational velocities. Here we introduce a modified version of one of these
  transformations proposed by Philip Franklin in 1922. The modified version is shown
  to resolve some of the drawbacks of the Franklin transformation, specially with
  respect to the corresponding spacetime metric in the rotating frame. This new transformation
  introduces non-inertial eccentric observers on a uniformly rotating disk and the
  corresponding metric in the rotating frame is shown to be consistent with the one
  obtained through Galilean rotational transformation for points close to the rotation
  axis. Employing the threading formulation of spacetime decomposition, spatial distances
  and time intervals in the spacetime metric of a rotating observer's frame are also
  discussed.
