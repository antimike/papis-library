abstract: We describe new ambitwistor string theories that give rise to the recent
  amplitude formulae for Einstein-Yang-Mills, (Dirac)-Born-Infeld, Galileons and others
  introduced by Cachazo, He and Yuan. In the case of the Einstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes,
  an important role is played by a novel worldsheet conformal field theory that provides
  the appropriate colour factors precisely without the spurious multitrace terms of
  earlier models that had to be ignored by hand. This is needed to obtain the correct
  multitrace terms that arise when Yang-Mills is coupled to gravity.
