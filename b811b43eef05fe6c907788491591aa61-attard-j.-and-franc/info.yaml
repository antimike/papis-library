abstract: Gauge symmetries are a cornerstone of modern physics but they come with
  technical difficulties when it comes to quantization, to accurately describe particles
  phenomenology or to extract observables in general. These shortcomings must be met
  by essentially finding a way to effectively reduce gauge symmetries. We propose
  a review of a way to do so which we call the dressing field method. We show how
  the BRST algebra satisfied by gauge fields, encoding their gauge transformations,
  is modified. We outline noticeable applications of the method, such as the electroweak
  sector of the Standard Model and the local twistors of Penrose.
