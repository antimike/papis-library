abstract: The formation of agents' opinions in a social system is the result of an
  intricate equilibrium among several driving forces. On the one hand, the social
  pressure exerted by peers favours the emergence of local consensus. On the other
  hand, the concurrent participation of agents to discussions on different topics
  induces each agent to develop a coherent set of opinions across all the topics in
  which he is active. Moreover, the pervasive action of external stimuli, such as
  mass media, pulls the entire population towards a specific configuration of opinions
  on different topics. Here we propose a model in which agents with interrelated opinions,
  interacting on several layers representing different topics, tend to spread their
  own ideas to their neighbourhood, strive to maintain internal coherence, due to
  the fact that each agent identifies meaningful relationships among its opinions
  on the different topics, and are at the same time subject to external fields, resembling
  the pressure of mass media. We show that the presence of heterogeneity in the internal
  coupling assigned by agents to their different opinions allows to obtain states
  with mixed levels of consensus, still ensuring that all the agents attain a coherent
  set of opinions. Furthermore, we show that all the observed features of the model
  are preserved in the presence of thermal noise up to a critical temperature, after
  which global consensus is no longer attainable. This suggests the relevance of our
  results for real social systems, where noise is inevitably present in the form of
  information uncertainty and misunderstandings. The model also demonstrates how mass
  media can be effectively used to favour the propagation of a chosen set of opinions,
  thus polarising the consensus of an entire population.
