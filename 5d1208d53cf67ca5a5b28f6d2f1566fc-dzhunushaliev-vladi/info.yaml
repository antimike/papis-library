abstract: The dual superconductor picture of the QCD vacuum is thought to describe
  the various aspects of the strong interaction including confinement. Ordinary superconductivity
  is described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation. In the present work we show that
  it is possible to arrive at a GL-like equation from pure SU(2) gauge theory. This
  is accomplished by using Abelian projection to split the SU(2) gauge fields into
  an Abelian subgroup and its coset. The two gauge field components of the coset part
  act as the effective, complex, scalar field of the GL equation. The Abelian part
  of the SU(2) gauge field is then analogous to the electromagnetic potential in the
  GL equation. An important feature of the dual superconducting model is for the GL
  Lagrangian to have a spontaneous symmetry breaking potential, and the existence
  of Nielsen-Olesen flux tube solutions. Both of these require a tachyonic mass for
  the effective scalar field. Such a tachyonic mass term is obtained from the condensation
  of ghost fields.
