abstract: We study entanglement properties of mixed density matrices obtained from
  combinatorial Laplacians. This is done by introducing the notion of the density
  matrix of a graph. We characterize the graphs with pure density matrices and show
  that the density matrix of a graph can be always written as a uniform mixture of
  pure density matrices of graphs. We consider the von Neumann entropy of these matrices
  and we characterize the graphs for which the minimum and maximum values are attained.
  We then discuss the problem of separability by pointing out that separability of
  density matrices of graphs does not always depend on the labelling of the vertices.
  We consider graphs with a tensor product structure and simple cases for which combinatorial
  properties are linked to the entanglement of the state. We calculate the concurrence
  of all graph on four vertices representing entangled states. It turns out that for
  some of these graphs the value of the concurrence is exactly fractional.
