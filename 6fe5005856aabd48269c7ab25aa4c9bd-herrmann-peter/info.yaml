abstract: Mutual trust is essential in performing economical transactions. In modern
  internet-based businesses, however, traditional trust gaining mechanisms cannot
  be used and new ways to build trust between e-business partners have to be found.
  In consequence, a lot of models describing trust and the mechanisms to build it
  were developed. Unfortunately, most of these models neither provide the right formalism
  to model relevant aspects of the trust gaining process (e.g., context and time of
  a trust-related interaction), nor do they allow refinement proofs verifying that
  a trust management tool implements a certain trust model. Therefore, we propose
  the temporal logic-based specification and verification technique cTLA which provides
  a formalism enabling to model context- and time-related aspects of a trust building
  process. Moreover, cTLA facilitates formal refinement proofs. In this paper, we
  discuss the application of cTLA to describe trust purposes by means of simple example
  systems which are used to decide about the application of certain policies based
  on the reputation of a party. In particular, we introduce a basic and a refined
  reputation system and sketch the proof that the refined system is a correct realization
  of the simple one.
