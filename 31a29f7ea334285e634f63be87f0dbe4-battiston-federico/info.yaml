abstract: Community structures in collaboration networks reflect the natural tendency
  of individuals to organize their work in groups in order to better achieve common
  goals. In most of the cases, individuals exploit their connections to introduce
  themselves to new areas of interests, giving rise to multifaceted collaborations
  which span different fields. In this paper, we analyse collaborations in science
  and among movie actors as multiplex networks, where the layers represent respectively
  research topics and movie genres, and we show that communities indeed coexist and
  overlap at the different layers of such systems. We then propose a model to grow
  multiplex networks based on two mechanisms of intra and inter-layer triadic closure
  which mimic the real processes by which collaborations evolve. We show that our
  model is able to explain the multiplex community structure observed empirically,
  and we infer the strength of the two underlying social mechanisms from real-world
  systems. Being also able to correctly reproduce the values of intra-layer and inter-layer
  assortativity correlations, the model contributes to a better understanding of the
  principles driving the evolution of social networks.
