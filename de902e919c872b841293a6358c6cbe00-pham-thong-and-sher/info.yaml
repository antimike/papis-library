abstract: Preferential attachment is a stochastic process that has been proposed to
  explain certain topological features characteristic of complex networks from diverse
  domains. The systematic investigation of preferential attachment is an important
  area of research in network science, not only for the theoretical matter of verifying
  whether this hypothesized process is operative in real-world networks, but also
  for the practical insights that follow from knowledge of its functional form. Here
  we describe a maximum likelihood based estimation method for the measurement of
  preferential attachment in temporal complex networks. We call the method PAFit,
  and implement it in an R package of the same name. PAFit constitutes an advance
  over previous methods primarily because we based it on a nonparametric statistical
  framework that enables attachment kernel estimation free of any assumptions about
  its functional form. We show this results in PAFit outperforming the popular methods
  of Jeong and Newman in Monte Carlo simulations. What is more, we found that the
  application of PAFit to a publically available Flickr social network dataset yielded
  clear evidence for a deviation of the attachment kernel from the popularly assumed
  log-linear form. Independent of our main work, we provide a correction to a consequential
  error in Newmanâ€™s original method which had evidently gone unnoticed since its publication
  over a decade ago.
