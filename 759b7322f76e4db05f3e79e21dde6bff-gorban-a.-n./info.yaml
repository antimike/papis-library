abstract: 'Is a spontaneous transition from a state x to a state y allowed by thermodynamics?
  Such a question arises often in chemical thermodynamics and kinetics. We ask the
  more formal question: is there a continuous path between these states, along which
  the conservation laws hold, the concentrations remain non-negative and the relevant
  thermodynamic potential G (Gibbs energy, for example) monotonically decreases? The
  obvious necessary condition, G(x)\geq G(y), is not sufficient, and we construct
  the necessary and sufficient conditions. For example, it is impossible to overstep
  the equilibrium in 1-dimensional (1D) systems (with n components and n-1 conservation
  laws). The system cannot come from a state x to a state y if they are on the opposite
  sides of the equilibrium even if G(x) > G(y). We find the general multidimensional
  analogue of this 1D rule and constructively solve the problem of the thermodynamically
  admissible transitions.   We study dynamical systems, which are given in a positively
  invariant convex polyhedron D and have a convex Lyapunov function G. An admissible
  path is a continuous curve along which $G$ does not increase. For x,y from D, x\geq
  y (x precedes y) if there exists an admissible path from x to y and x \sim y if
  x\geq y and y\geq x. The tree of G in D is a quotient space D/~. We provide an algorithm
  for the construction of this tree. In this algorithm, the restriction of G onto
  the 1-skeleton of $D$ (the union of edges) is used. The problem of existence of
  admissible paths between states is solved constructively. The regions attainable
  by the admissible paths are described.'
