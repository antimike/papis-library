abstract: Since Wilson's work on lattice gauge theory in the 1970s, discrete versions
  of field theories have played a vital role in fundamental physics. But there is
  recent interest in certain higher dimensional analogues of gauge theory, such as
  p-form electromagnetism, including the Kalb-Ramond field in string theory, and its
  nonabelian generalizations. It is desirable to discretize such `higher gauge theories'
  in a way analogous to lattice gauge theory, but with the fundamental geometric structures
  in the discretization boosted in dimension. As a step toward studying discrete versions
  of more general higher gauge theories, we consider the case of p-form electromagnetism.
  We show that discrete p-form electromagnetism admits a simple algebraic description
  in terms of chain complexes of abelian groups. Moreover, the model allows discrete
  spacetimes with quite general geometry, in contrast to the regular cubical lattices
  usually associated with lattice gauge theory. After constructing a suitable model
  of discrete spacetime for p-form electromagnetism, we quantize the theory using
  the Euclidean path integral formalism. The main result is a description of p-form
  electromagnetism as a `chain field theory' -- a theory analogous to topological
  quantum field theory, but with chain complexes replacing manifolds. This, in particular,
  gives a notion of time evolution from one `spacelike slice' of discrete spacetime
  to another.
