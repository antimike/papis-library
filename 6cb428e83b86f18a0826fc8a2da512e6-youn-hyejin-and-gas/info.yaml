abstract: Uncoordinated individuals in human society pursuing their personally optimal
  strategies do not always achieve the social optimum, the most beneficial state to
  the society as a whole. Instead, strategies form Nash equilibria which are often
  socially suboptimal. Society, therefore, has to pay a price of anarchy for the lack
  of coordination among its members. Here we assess this price of anarchy by analyzing
  the travel times in road networks of several major cities. Our simulation shows
  that uncoordinated drivers possibly waste a considerable amount of their travel
  time. Counterintuitively,simply blocking certain streets can partially improve the
  traffic conditions. We analyze various complex networks and discuss the possibility
  of similar paradoxes in physics.
