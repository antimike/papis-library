abstract: We consider finite-element methods for the approximation of solutions of
  the Ginzburg-Landau equations of superconductivity. The methods are based on a discretization
  of the Euler-Lagrange equations resulting from the minimization of the free-energy
  functional. The discretization is effected by requiring the approximate solution
  to be a piecewise polynomial with respect to a grid. The magnetization versus magnetic
  field curves obtained through the finite-element methods agree well with analogous
  calculations obtained by other schemes. We demonstrate, both by analyzing the algorithms
  and through computational experiments, that finite-element methods can be very effective
  and efficient means for the computational simulation of superconductivity phenomena
  and therefore could be applied to determine macroscopic properties of inhomogeneous,
  anisotropic superconductors. Â© 1992 The American Physical Society.
