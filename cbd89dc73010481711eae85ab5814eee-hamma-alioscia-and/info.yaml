abstract: A number of recent proposals for a quantum theory of gravity are based on
  the idea that spacetime geometry and gravity are derivative concepts and only apply
  at an approximate level. There are two fundamental challenges to any such approach.
  At the conceptual level, there is a clash between the "timelessness" of general
  relativity and emergence. Second, the lack of a fundamental spacetime makes difficult
  the straightforward application of well-known methods of statistical physics to
  the problem. We recently initiated a study of such problems using spin systems based
  on evolution of quantum networks with no a priori geometric notions as models for
  emergent geometry and gravity. In this article we review two such models. The first
  is a model of emergent (flat) space and matter and we show how to use methods from
  quantum information theory to derive features such as speed of light from a non-geometric
  quantum system. The second model exhibits interacting matter and geometry, with
  the geometry defined by the behavior of matter. This model has primitive notions
  of gravitational attraction which we illustrate with a toy black hole, and exhibits
  entanglement between matter and geometry and thermalization of the quantum geometry.
