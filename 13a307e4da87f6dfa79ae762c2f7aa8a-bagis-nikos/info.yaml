abstract: In this article we solve a general class of sextic equations. The solution
  follows if we consider the $j$-invariant and relate it with the polynomial equation's
  coefficients. The form of the solution is a relation of Rogers-Ramanujan continued
  fraction. The inverse technique can also be used for the evaluation of the Rogers-Ramanujan
  continued fraction, in which the equation is not now the depressed equation but
  another quite more simplified equation.
