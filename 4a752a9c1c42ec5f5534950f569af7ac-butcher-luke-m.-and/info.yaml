abstract: 'In a previous article [Phys. Rev. D 82 104040 (2010)], we derived an energy-momentum
  tensor for linear gravity that exhibited positive energy density and causal energy
  flux. Here we extend this framework by localizing the angular momentum of the linearized
  gravitational field, deriving a gravitational spin tensor which possesses similarly
  desirable properties. By examining the local exchange of angular momentum (between
  matter and gravity) we find that gravitational intrinsic spin is localized, separately
  from orbital angular momentum, in terms of a gravitational spin tensor. This spin
  tensor is then uniquely determined by requiring that it obey two simple physically
  motivated algebraic conditions. Firstly, the spin of an arbitrary (harmonic-gauge)
  gravitational plane wave is required to flow in the direction of propagation of
  the wave. Secondly, the spin tensor of any transverse-traceless gravitational field
  is required to be traceless. (The second condition ensures that local field redefinitions
  suffice to cast our gravitational energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor as sources
  of gravity in a quadratic approximation to general relativity.) Additionally, the
  following properties arise in the spin tensor spontaneously: all transverse-traceless
  fields have purely spatial spin, and any field generated by a static distribution
  of matter will carry no spin at all. Following the structure of our previous paper,
  we then examine the (spatial) angular momentum exchanged between the gravitational
  field and an infinitesimal detector, and develop a microaveraging procedure that
  renders the process gauge-invariant. The exchange of nonspatial angular momentum
  (i.e., moment of energy) is also analyzed, leading us to conclude that a gravitational
  wave can displace the center of mass of the detector; this conclusion is also confirmed
  by a first principles treatment of the system. Finally, we discuss...'
