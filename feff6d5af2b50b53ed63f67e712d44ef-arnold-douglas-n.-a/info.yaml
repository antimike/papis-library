abstract: 'This article reports on the confluence of two streams of research, one
  emanating from the fields of numerical analysis and scientific computation, the
  other from topology and geometry. In it we consider the numerical discretization
  of partial differential equations that are related to differential complexes so
  that de Rham cohomology and Hodge theory are key tools for the continuous problem.
  After a brief introduction to finite element methods, the discretization methods
  we consider, we develop an abstract Hilbert space framework for analyzing stability
  and convergence. In this framework, the differential complex is represented by a
  complex of Hilbert spaces and stability is obtained by transferring Hodge theoretic
  structures from the continuous level to the discrete. We show stable discretization
  is achieved if the finite element spaces satisfy two hypotheses: they form a subcomplex
  and there exists a bounded cochain projection from the full complex to the subcomplex.
  Next, we consider the most canonical example of the abstract theory, in which the
  Hilbert complex is the de Rham complex of a domain in Euclidean space. We use the
  Koszul complex to construct two families of finite element differential forms, show
  that these can be arranged in subcomplexes of the de Rham complex in numerous ways,
  and for each construct a bounded cochain projection. The abstract theory therefore
  applies to give the stability and convergence of finite element approximations of
  the Hodge Laplacian. Other applications are considered as well, especially to the
  equations of elasticity. Background material is included to make the presentation
  self-contained for a variety of readers.'
