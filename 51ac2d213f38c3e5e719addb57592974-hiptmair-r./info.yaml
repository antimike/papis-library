abstract: "<jats:p>This article discusses finite element Galerkin schemes for a number\
  \ of linear \nmodel problems in electromagnetism. The finite element schemes are\
  \ introduced \nas discrete differential forms, matching the coordinate-independent\
  \ \nstatement of Maxwell's equations in the calculus of differential forms. The\
  \ \nasymptotic convergence of discrete solutions is investigated theoretically.\
  \ As \ndiscrete differential forms represent a genuine generalization of conventional\
  \ \nLagrangian finite elements, the analysis is based upon a judicious adaptation\
  \ \nof established techniques in the theory of finite elements. Risks and difficulties\
  \ \nhaunting finite element schemes that do not fit the framework of discrete differential\
  \ \nforms are highlighted.</jats:p>"
