abstract: A conformally covariant formulation of operator product expansion is discussed
  as an expansion of the product of two representations into a direct sum of irreducible
  representations. The basic irreducible representations are analyzed and classified.
  The isomorphism between the conformal algebra and the O(4, 2) algebra is used to
  obtain a manifestly covariant formalism. The implications of the isomorphism in
  the derivation of the representations is discussed. The covariant O(4, 2) formalism
  directly relates dominant terms to nondominant terms in the light-cone limit. The
  essential coincidence of the problem of a conformal covariant operator product expansion
  to the problem of determining the form of the three-point function is stressed,
  together with the relevance of a selection rule for two-point functions following
  from exact (not spontaneously broken) conformal covariance. The role of Ward identities
  in a conformal covariant scheme is pointed out, and the mathematical implications
  on the n-point functions from causality are described.
