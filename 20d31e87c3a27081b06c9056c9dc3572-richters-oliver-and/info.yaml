abstract: 'Non-centralized recommendation-based decision making is a central feature
  of several social and technological processes, such as market dynamics, peer-to-peer
  file-sharing and the web of trust of digital certification. We investigate the properties
  of trust propagation on networks, based on a simple metric of trust transitivity.
  We investigate analytically the percolation properties of trust transitivity in
  random networks with arbitrary in/out-degree distributions, and compare with numerical
  realizations. We find that the existence of a non-zero fraction of absolute trust
  (i.e. entirely confident trust) is a requirement for the viability of global trust
  propagation in large systems: The average pair-wise trust is marked by a discontinuous
  transition at a specific fraction of absolute trust, below which it vanishes. Furthermore,
  we perform an extensive analysis of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) web of trust,
  in view of the concepts introduced. We compare different scenarios of trust distribution:
  community- and authority-centered. We find that these scenarios lead to sharply
  different patterns of trust propagation, due to the segregation of authority hubs
  and densely-connected communities. While the authority-centered scenario is more
  efficient, and leads to higher average trust values, it favours weakly-connected
  ``fringe'''' nodes, which are directly trusted by authorities. The community-centered
  scheme, on the other hand, favours nodes with intermediate in/out-degrees, in detriment
  of the authorities and its ``fringe'''' peers.'
