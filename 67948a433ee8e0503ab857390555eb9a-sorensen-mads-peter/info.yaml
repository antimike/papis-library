abstract: We investigate the dynamics of magnetic vortices in type II superconductors
  with normal state pinning sites using the Ginzburg–Landau equations. Simulation
  results demonstrate hopping of vortices between pinning sites, influenced by external
  magnetic fields and external currents. The system is highly nonlinear and the vortices
  show complex nonlinear dynamical behaviour.
