abstract: In the context of investigations of possible highly relativistic motions
  of a spinning particle in the gravitational field, which can be described by the
  Mathisson equations under different supplementary condition, we analyze the circular
  orbits in a Schwarzschild field. The very orbits most clearly demonstrate the effect
  of the gravitational spin-orbit interaction on the particle's motion. It is shown
  that the Mathisson equations under the Frenkel-Mathisson and Tulczyjew-Dixon conditions
  have the common solutions describing the highly relativistic circular orbits in
  the region $r=3M(1+\delta), |\delta|\ll 1$. These orbits essentially differ from
  the geodesic circular orbits in the same region, particularly by the value of the
  particle's energy on the corresponding orbits.
