abstract: Abstract We critically review concepts of self-organization and self-assembly,
  and extract from this analysis consistent and workable definitions of both concepts
  that are applicable across many scientific disciplines. In essence, we distinguish
  self-organization from self-assembly on a thermodynamic basis, where self-organization
  implies a nonequilibrium process and self-assembly is reserved for spontaneous processes
  tending toward equilibrium. This discrimination is consistent with early uses of
  both terms. Â© 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity, 2008.
