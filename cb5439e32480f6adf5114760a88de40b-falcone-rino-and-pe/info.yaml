abstract: The approaches to the trust study are various and very different each of
  other. In our view, just a socio-cognitive approach to trust would be able to analyze
  the sub-components (the basic beliefs) on which the final decision to trust or not
  is taken. In this paper we show a first implementation and advance of the socio-cognitive
  model of trust developed in [1],[ 2] using the so-called Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. With
  this implementation we show how the different components may change and how their
  impact can change depending from the specific situation and from the agent personality.
