abstract: We consider the holographic duality between type-A higher-spin gravity in
  AdS_4 and the free U(N) vector model. In the bulk, linearized solutions can be translated
  into twistor functions via the Penrose transform. We propose a holographic dual
  to this transform, which translates between twistor functions and CFT sources and
  operators. We present a twistorial expression for the partition function, which
  makes global higher-spin symmetry manifest, and appears to automatically include
  all necessary contact terms. In this picture, twistor space provides a fully nonlocal,
  gauge-invariant description underlying both bulk and boundary spacetime pictures.
  While the bulk theory is handled at the linear level, our formula for the partition
  function includes the effects of bulk interactions. Thus, the CFT is used to solve
  the bulk, with twistors as a language common to both. A key ingredient in our result
  is the study of ordinary spacetime symmetries within the fundamental representation
  of higher-spin algebra. The object that makes these "square root" spacetime symmetries
  manifest becomes the kernel of our boundary/twistor transform, while the original
  Penrose transform is identified as a "square root" of CPT.
