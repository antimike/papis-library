abstract: In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with
  each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships,
  change in time, and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple
  subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such "multilayer"
  features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently,
  it is necessary to generalize "traditional" network theory by developing (and validating)
  a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive
  fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple
  disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most
  important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of
  multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work
  on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent
  work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary
  of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other, and provide
  a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts, and translates between related notions
  such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks
  of networks, and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that
  can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network
  diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research
  on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components,
  tensor decompositions, and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks.
  We conclude with a summary and an outlook.
