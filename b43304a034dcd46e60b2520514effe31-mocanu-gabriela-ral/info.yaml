abstract: Boson clouds around black holes exhibit interesting physical phenomena through
  the Penrose process of superradiance, leading to black hole spin-down. Axionic clouds
  are of particular interest, since the axion Compton wavelength could be comparable
  to the Schwarzschild radius, leading to the formation of "gravitational atoms" with
  a black hole nucleus. These clouds collapse under certain conditions, leading to
  a "Bosenova". We model the dynamics of such unstable boson clouds by a simple cellular
  automaton and show that it exhibits self-organized criticality. Our results suggest
  that the evolution through the black hole Regge plane is due to self-organized criticality.
