abstract: We introduce a new method to efficiently approximate the number of infections
  resulting from a given initially-infected node in a network of susceptible individuals.
  Our approach is based on counting the number of possible infection walks of various
  lengths to each other node in the network. We analytically study the properties
  of our method, in particular demonstrating different forms for SIS and SIR disease
  spreading (e.g. under the SIR model our method counts self-avoiding walks). In comparison
  to existing methods to infer the spreading efficiency of different nodes in the
  network (based on degree, k-shell decomposition analysis and different centrality
  measures), our method directly considers the spreading process and, as such, is
  unique in providing estimation of actual numbers of infections. Crucially, in simulating
  infections on various real-world networks with the SIR model, we show that our walks-based
  method improves the inference of effectiveness of nodes over a wide range of infection
  rates compared to existing methods. We also analyse the trade-off between estimate
  accuracy and computational cost, showing that the better accuracy here can still
  be obtained at a comparable computational cost to other methods.
