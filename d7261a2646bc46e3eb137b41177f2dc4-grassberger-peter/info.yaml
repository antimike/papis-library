abstract: 'Quantities are defined operationally which qualify as measures of complexity
  of patterns arising in physical situations. Their main features, distinguishing
  them from previously used quantities, are the following: (1) they are measuretheoretic
  concepts, more closely related to Shannon entropy than to computational complexity;
  and (2) they are observables related to ensembles of patterns, not to individual
  patterns. Indeed, they are essentially Shannon information needed to specify not
  individual patterns, but either measure-theoretic or algebraic properties of ensembles
  of patterns arising ina priori translationally invariant situations. Numerical estimates
  of these complexities are given for several examples of patterns created by maps
  and by cellular automata.'
