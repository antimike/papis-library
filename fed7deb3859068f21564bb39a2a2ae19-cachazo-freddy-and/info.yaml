abstract: This paper presents a new formula which is conjectured to yield all tree
  amplitudes in N=8 supergravity. The amplitudes are described in terms of higher
  degree rational maps to twistor space. The resulting expression has manifest N=8
  supersymmetry and is manifestly permutation symmetric in all external states. It
  depends monomially on the infinity twistor that explicitly breaks conformal symmetry
  to Poincare. The formula has been explicitly checked to yield the correct amplitudes
  for the 3-point MHV-bar and for the n-point MHV, where it reduces to an expression
  of Hodges. We have also carried out numerical checks of the formula at NMHV and
  NNMHV level, for up to eight external states.
