abstract: Thermodynamic length is a metric distance between equilibrium thermodynamic
  states. Among other interesting properties, this metric asymptotically bounds the
  dissipation induced by a finite time transformation of a thermodynamic system. It
  is also connected to the Jensen-Shannon divergence, Fisher information and Rao's
  entropy differential metric. Therefore, thermodynamic length is of central interest
  in understanding matter out-of-equilibrium. In this paper, we will consider how
  to define thermodynamic length for a small system described by equilibrium statistical
  mechanics and how to measure thermodynamic length within a computer simulation.
  Surprisingly, Bennett's classic acceptance ratio method for measuring free energy
  differences also measures thermodynamic length.
